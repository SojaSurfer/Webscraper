Biden today announced in a video statement posted on his website www.JoeBiden.com that he has filed the necessary paperwork to become a candidate for President of the United States.\n\"I am heartened by the response so many people have given to my call for a new direction in American foreign policy and to our focus on middle class concerns,\" said Sen. Biden.\nIn the video statement, Biden stressed the disastrous results of the Bush Administration's failed policies and handling of Iraq.\n\"In my view, President Bush has dug America into a very deep hole,\" said Sen. Biden. \"This administration's mishandling of the war in Iraq may be the greatest foreign policy disaster of all time.\"\nBiden said the next president must be prepared to change our policy in Iraq immediately upon entering office, \"The next President of the United States must be prepared to immediately step in and act without hesitation to end our involvement in the Iraq conflict without further destabilizing the Middle East and the world.\"\nBiden also emphasized the need for a change in direction more broadly in both foreign and domestic policies, stating, \"To restore America's place in the world, we also must focus on the hopes and needs of our own people. The Bush administration because it worships profits over people has forgotten that to make America strong, we need a growing, vibrant middle-class.\nWe need our citizens to feel secure. Secure that their children will be cared for if they are ill. Secure that they will have a retirement income they can count on. Secure that we are doing all we can to end global warming. Secure that their jobs and opportunities will not vanish like so many have in recent years.\"\nBiden said he would make a more formal presentation of the prospective policies and principles of a Biden Administration over the next several months.\nTo watch the video statement or for more information on the campaign, please visit: www.JoeBiden.com.\n",

    "text": "\nToday, the Senate takes the first step in a bipartisan effort to prevent the escalation of the war in Iraq - and to adopt a new strategy for leaving Iraq without leaving chaos behind.\nThat first step is to debate and vote on the resolution offered by Senator Warner, and re-introduced by Senator Levin and me as a bill, that says that the Senate disagrees with the President's plan to send 17,500 more American troops into the middle of a civil war in Baghdad.\nThe question before us today is whether a minority of Senators will even allow the debate to start. That's what we are about to vote on.\nTo my colleagues who are thinking about trying to block debate, let me say this: Iraq dominates our national life. It is on the minds of tens of millions of Americans. It shapes the lives of hundreds of thousands of our men and women in uniform and their families.\nThat the Senate would not even debate, much less vote on, the single most urgent issue of our time, would be a total forfeiture of our responsibility. We have a duty to debate and vote on the President's plan. We have a duty to debate and vote on our overall strategy in Iraq. And we have the duty as United States Senators to demonstrate the courage of our convictions.\nThree weeks ago, Secretary of State Rice presented the President's plan for Iraq to the Foreign Relations Committee. Its main feature is to send more American troops into Baghdad, in the middle of a sectarian war. The reaction on the Committee, from Republicans and Democrats alike, ranged from skepticism to profound skepticism to outright opposition. And that pretty much reflects the reaction all across the country.\nSenator Hagel, Senator Levin, Senator Snowe and I wrote a resolution to give Senators a way to vote what their voices were saying. We believe that the quickest, most effective way to get the President to change course is to demonstrate to him that his policy has little or no support across the board.\nAfter we introduced our resolution, Senator Warner came forward with his. The bottom line of our resolutions is the same: Mr. President, don't send more Americans into the middle of civil war.\nThere was one critical difference. As originally written, Senator Warner's resolution left open the possibility of increasing the overall number of American troops in Iraq. We believed that would send the wrong message.\nWe should be drawing down, not ramping up, and redeploying our forces that remain in Iraq. That's the best way to make it clear to the Iraqi leaders that they must begin to make the hard compromises necessary for the political solution virtually everyone agrees is necessary. We approached Senator Warner to work out the differences. I am very pleased to say that we succeeded in doing just that.\nThe language Senator Warner removed from his resolution removed the possibility that it could be read as calling for more U.S. troops in Iraq. With that change, we agreed to support his resolution.\nWhen I first spoke out against the President's planned surge before the New Year, I made it clear that I hoped to build and demonstrate bi-partisan opposition to his plan because that was the fastest way to turn him around. And that is exactly what we have done.\nNow, we have a real opportunity for the Senate to speak clearly. Every Senator should be given a chance to vote whether he or she approves or disapproves with the President's plan to send more troops into the middle of a civil war. The debate we will have is as important as the vote. I hope the American people listen carefully.\nI predict they will hear very few of our colleagues stand up and support the President's plan to send more troops into the middle of a civil war. Listen to the voices - as well as the votes.\nJust as important as what we are voting against, is what we are voting for.\nThis bill, like the Biden-Hagel-Levin-Snowe bill makes three things clear.\n\nFirst, Iraq needs a political settlement to end the sectarian violence.\nSecond, the United States must work with other nations to develop a \"regional, internationally-sponsored peace and reconciliation process for Iraq.\"\nThird, the mission of US armed forces should be confined to counter-terrorism, training, and maintaining the territorial integrity of Iraq. The mission should not include policing a sectarian civil war. That will require significantly fewer troops than we have in Iraq now.\n\nAs I said at the outset, this is a first step. But it can set the foundation for everything that follows. If the President does not listen to the majority of Congress and the majority of the American people, we will look at other ways to turn the surge around.\nEven if we succeed in that effort, we still need to turn our overall Iraq policy around. We need a strategy that can produce a political settlement in Iraq. That's the only way to stop Shiites and Sunnis from killing each other and to allow our troops to leave Iraq without trading a dictator for chaos.\nI have proposed just such a strategy, and I'll have more to say about it in the days ahead.\nBut for today, my message is simple: the American people want us to debate Iraq, the most important issue of our day. They expect it. They demand it. If we try to hide behind procedure and delaying tactics, the American people will hold us accountable. They get it.\nThe question is: do we?\nAre we for or against the President's plan to escalate the war in Iraq? I am against it and I believe the majority of my colleagues are as well.\n",

    "text": "\nThis is a time of tremendous challenge for America in the world.\nWe must contend with the on-going war in Afghanistan, the genocide in Darfur, nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea, the rise of China and re-emergence Russia, the growing insecurity of our energy supply, the fragility of our climate, and the threat posed by radical fundamentalism.\nBut one issue dominates our national debate: Iraq.\nIf we deal with it successfully, we can recover the freedom, flexibility and credibility to meet these other challenges.\nThats what I want to talk about today.\n* * *\nListen to the debate about Iraq here in Washington. It centers on a false choice that is also a bad choice: Do we continue on President Bushs failing course and hand off Iraq to the next President? Or do we just leave and hope for the best?\nI believe there is a better choice. It is still possible to bring our troops home without trading a dictator for chaos that engulfs Iraq and spreads to the Middle East.\nThat must be our goal.\n* * *\nLeaving Iraq is necessary -- but it is not a plan. We also need a plan for what we leave behind.\nNine months ago, with Les Gelb of the Council on Foreign Relations, I proposed just such a plan. Go to planforiraq.com. to read its details.\nOur plan recognizes that there is no purely military exit strategy from Iraq. Instead, we set out a roadmap to a political settlement in Iraq -- one that gives its warring factions a way to share power peacefully and offers us a chance to leave with our interests intact.\nThe plan has five major pieces.\nFirst, maintain a unified Iraq by decentralizing it and giving Kurds, Shiites and Sunnis breathing room in regions as the Iraqi constitution provides. The central government would be responsible for common concerns, like guarding Iraqs borders and distributing its oil revenues.\nSecond, secure support from the Sunnis who have no oil by guaranteeing them a fair share of oil revenues. Allow former Baath party members to go back to work and reintegrate Sunnis with no blood on their hands.\nThird, increase economic assistance to Iraq and its regions. Insist that the oil-rich Gulf states put up most of the money, tie it to the protection of minority rights, and create a major jobs program to deny the militia new recruits.\nFourth, initiate a major diplomatic offensive to enlist the support of Iraqs neighbors. Create an oversight group of the U.N. and the major powers to enforce their commitments. These countries have a profound stake in preventing chaos in Iraq and the credibility we lack to press for compromise by all Iraqis. If a political settlement fails to take hold, these same countries are vital to any strategy to contain the fall out within Iraq.\nFifth, instruct the military to draw up plans for withdrawing U.S. combat forces from Iraq by 2008. Leave behind a small force to take on terrorists and train Iraqis. The best way to focus Iraqs leaders on the political compromises they must make is to make it clear to them that we are leaving.\n* * *\nMany of you have heard me talk about this plan before.\nWhats new is the growing support its receiving.\nThat support was evident during the four weeks of hearings we just held in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\nIt is evident in the new National Intelligence Estimate for Iraq a consensus report of all U.S. intelligence agencies.\nThe NIE and virtually all of our witnesses agreed that the fundamental problem in Iraq is self-sustaining sectarian violence.\nYes, jihadists, Baathists, criminal gangs and intra-sect violence all contribute to the growing chaos. But Sunnis killing Shiites and Shiites killing Sunnis is the heart of the matter. Thats what we have to stop if we want to leave Iraq with our interests intact.\nHow do we stop this sectarian cycle of revenge?\nIf history is any guide, we have to wait until one side wins or both sides exhaust themselves. That could take years of bloodletting... years that we do not have.\nHistory also suggests it is possible to short circuit sectarian strife.\nA decade ago, Bosnia was being torn apart by ethnic cleansing, which threatened to engulf the Balkans. The United States stepped in with Dayton Accords, which kept the country whole by, paradoxically, dividing it into ethnic federations. Muslims, Croats and Serbs retained separate armies and presidents. Since then, Bosnians have lived a decade in peace. Now, they are slowly coming back together.\nIraq presents a similar possibility. Heres what the National Intelligence Estimate says we need:\nBroader Sunni acceptance of the current political structure and federalism [and] significant concessions by Shia and Kurds to create space for Sunni acceptance of federalism.\nThat is exactly the strategy behind the Biden-Gelb plan.\nDuring our hearings, witness after witness including former secretaries of states, foreign policy experts, and elected officials -- came to a similar conclusion. So have a growing number of opinion makers.\nWhat more and more people are beginning to recognize is that there are very few possible futures for Iraq in the near term and only one that protects Americas interests.\n* * *\nThink for a minute about Iraqs possible futures.\nThe Bush administration has one vision: that Iraqis will rally behind a strong, democratic central government that keeps the country together and protects the rights of all citizens equally.\nBut since the Samarra Mosque bombing a year ago, that vision has been engulfed by the flames of sectarian hatred.\nThe hard truth in Iraq is that there is no trust within the central government no trust of the government by the people and no capacity by the government to deliver services and security. And there is no evidence none that we can build that trust and capacity any time soon.\nThere are two other ways to govern Iraq from the center:\nA foreign occupation that the United States cannot long sustain. Or the return of a strongman, who is not on the horizon. Even if he were, replacing one dictator with another would require a savagery to rival Saddams worst excesses.\nSo where does that leave us?\nIt leaves us with an idea a large majority of Iraqis have already endorsed in their constitution and that our plan would help make a reality: federalism.\nFederalism would keep Iraq together by vesting real power in the regions.\nIt would bring decisions and responsibility down to the local level and give Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds control over the fabric of their daily lives: security, education, marriage, jobs.\nVery few have read Iraqs constitution. Fewer still understand that legislation to implement its articles on federalism takes effect in 15 months.\nFederalism is Iraqs best possible future.\nBut unless we help make federalism work for all Iraqis, the violence will not stop.\nWe have to convince the major powers and Iraqs neighbors that a federal Iraq is the best possible outcome for them, too, and to put their weight and influence behind it. Then, together, we have to bring in the Sunnis and convince the Shiites and Kurds to make concessions.\nThat is what the Biden-Gelb plan proposes. It demands the kind of sustained, hard headed diplomacy for which this administration has shown little interest or aptitude. But it offers the possibility not the guarantee of producing a soft landing in Iraq.\nIf we fail to make federalism work, there will be no political accommodation at the center. Violent resistance will increase. The sectarian cycle of revenge will spiral out of control. At best, the result likely will be the violent break up of Iraq into multiple failed states. At worst, the result will be Iraqs total fragmentation into warring fiefdoms.\nThe neighbors will not sit on the sidelines. Already, Iraq has aggravated a deep Sunni-Shiite divide that runs from Lebanon through Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. This fault-line intersects with other cultural and political rifts between Arabs and Persians, Turks and Kurds, jihadis and the Muslim mainstream to create the conditions for a cataclysmic explosion.\nIran and the Arab states will back Shia and Sunni extremists as part of a proxy war. Eventually, they will intervene directly. Sunni Jihadis will flood Iraq to confront the Persian and Shia threat, creating a new haven for terrorists. Turkey will move into the North to crush Kurdish ambitions. Sunni-Shia tensions will rise from Beirut to Karachi.\nIndividually, these would be bad developments. Together, they would do terrible damage to American interests. We must lead a determined regional and international effort to end the Iraqi civil war, or contain it if we cant.\n* * *\nThe Bush administration is heading in exactly the wrong direction.\nInstead of a diplomatic and political offensive to forge a political settlement, it proposes a military offensive that would send 17,500 Americans into the middle of a sectarian conflict in a city of 6.2 million people.\nThis military surge in Iraq is not a solution it is a tragic mistake.\nIf we should be surging forces anywhere, it is in Afghanistan.\nIm glad the President has recognized what many of us have been saying for years: unless we surge troops, hardware, money, and high-level attention into Afghanistan, it will fall back into the hands of the Taliban, terrorists and drug traffickers. I support the steps he announced today but I hope they are the first steps not the last in a recommitment to Afghanistan.\n* * *\nThe House is about to pronounce itself on the Presidents surge plan for Iraq and the Senate will, too.\nSome minimize the significance of a non-binding resolution. If it is so meaningless, why did the White House and the Presidents political supporters mobilize so much energy against it?\nOpposing the surge is only a first step. We need a radical change in course in Iraq. If the President wont act, Congress will.\nBut Congress must act responsibly. We must resist the temptation to push for changes that sound good but produce bad results.\nThe best next step is to revisit the authorization Congress granted the President in 2002 to use force in Iraq. Thats exactly what Im doing.\nWe gave the President that power to destroy Iraqs weapons of mass destruction and, if necessary, to depose Saddam Hussein.\nThe WMD were not there. Saddam Hussein is no longer there. The 2002 authorization is no longer relevant to the situation in Iraq.\nI am working on legislation to repeal that authorization and replace it with a much narrower mission statement for our troops in Iraq.\nCongress should make clear what the mission of our troops is: to responsibly draw down, while continuing to combat terrorists, train Iraqis and respond to emergencies. We should make equally clear what their mission is not: to stay in Iraq indefinitely and get mired in a savage civil war.\nCoupled with the Biden-Gelb plan, I believe this is the most effective way to start bringing our troops home without leaving a mess behind.\n* * *\nI want to leave you with one thought.\nFor our sake and for the sake of the Iraqi people, we should be focused on how we get out of Iraq with our interests intact.\nEveryone wants to bring our troops home as soon and as safely as possible. But tempting as it is, we cant just throw up our hands, blame the President for misusing the authority we gave him, and walk away without a plan for what we leave behind.\nSo Ill end where I began.\nLeaving Iraq is a necessity, but it is not a plan. We need a plan for what we leave behind. That is what I have offered.\nTo those who disagree with my plan, I have one simple question: what is your alternative?\n",

We have a war in Afghanistan, genocide in Darfur, there are two nations out there developing nuclear weapons - and at home we need a healthcare policy, access to college education, and beyond that, an energy plan.\nWe cannot fix these other problems unless we deal with Iraq. It affects every other aspect of our policies. Biden said. If we do it right well regain the flexibility, the credibility and our ability to deal with all the problems youve heard talked about today. But if we don't get it right, we are going to be shackled financially and in every other way for a long time to come.\nIn his closing, Biden stressed that President Bush has left the next president of the United States with no for margin for error, telling the audience that in the next election, The American people, we have an incredible opportunity to change the world.\n",

Between his experience on foreign policy and national security issues and his life story, I believe that he is the most qualified to be our next president. I really appreciate that he has not lost touch with where he came from.\nI am supporting Joe Biden in my role as an elected official in this state and more importantly in my role as a father, said Representative Govan, the father of four including one daughter who currently serves in the United States Air Force.\nIve known Joe Biden for over twenty years and without a doubt can say that he is the man for the job. I am concerned about where this country is and where we are headed. We need a leader who has both the confidence and the credibility at home and around the world to lead us in a new direction and he is that leader.\nI am extremely honored to have the support of both Senator Malloy and Representative Govan, said Biden. They are both incredibly important leaders in their communities and throughout the state.

    "text": "\nSuccess in Afghanistan is Still Possible if We Surge Forces Anywhere, it Should be in Afghanistan, not Iraq.\nToday we face an issue at the very heart of our war on terror: the deteriorating security conditions in Afghanistan. If current trends continue, we may soon find that our hard-won success on the battlefield has melted away.\nI didnt write these words in preparation for this mornings hearing. I spoke them nearly five years ago, on the floor of the United States Senate. [May 17, 2002]\nIm not bringing up old quotes to say, I told you so, but to make a simple point: the situation in Afghanistan is not an unforeseen circumstance. Plenty of military and civilian officials have been predicting exactly this outcome for years.\nWhats the state of play? Osama bin Laden remains at large, right across the border in Pakistan in all probability. There are reports that hes reconstituted his terrorist training camps. Given the chance to kill him at Tora Bora, the administration instead pulled most of our Special Forces, our CIA teams and Predators and sent them to Iraq.\nThe Taliban is back -- and keeping much of Afghanistan ungovernable. Suicide bombings, IEDs and other techniques imported from Iraq made last year the bloodiest since their ouster.\nThe government of Pakistan turns a blind eye to the Taliban cross-border attacks, and to the high command based in Quetta. Just last year, the government signed a separate peace with pro-Taliban militias in Waziristan.\nAfghan reconstruction is stuck in first gear. President Bush promised a Marshall Plan, but he's delivered less development aid in the past five years than we spend on the war in Iraq every three weeks.\nLast year Afghanistan produced 92% of the worlds opium. The proceeds prop up the Taliban, warlords and corrupt officials. Theres no serious counter-narcotics program. If the Administration pursues a poorly-conceived aerial poppy eradication plan, the results could be even worse.\nDont get me wrongweve accomplished some great things. Because of our efforts, millions of Afghan children are in school today. Weve built roads and clinics. Weve got American troops in Provincial Reconstruction Teams showing that the US military can be a wonderful friend as well as a fearsome enemy.\nPresident Bush last month made two encouraging statements. First, he announced the deployment of an additional combat brigade to Afghanistan. This is important, because our NATO commanders desperately need not only several thousand battle-ready troops, but the helicopters, transport aircraft, and other military hardware that go with them. Second, he pledged $11.8 billion in new funding over the next two years. If these figures represent new funding in addition to currently-budgeted numbers, and if we focus on projects which bring real improvement to the lives of ordinary Afghansthis may be the start of a more successful strategy.\nI certainly hope so. Because in Afghanistan, success still is possible. Failure is not thinkable. How can we turn things around? Very briefly, we need to do three things:\nFirst, establish security. If we should be surging forces anywhere, its in Afghanistan, not Iraq. NATO troops are necessary, but not sufficient. Weve also got to train the Afghan police and armywhich means, for starters, paying them decent salaries.\nSecond, we have get moving on reconstruction. We need more funds, and we need to use them better. The Afghans are patient, but theyre not seeing reconstruction worthy of a superpower. As Gen. Eikenberry has said, Where the road ends, the Taliban begins.\nThird, do counter-narcotics right. We should target multimillion-dollar drug kingpins, not the dollar-a-day opium farmers. Someday aerial eradication may have a placebut not until weve got alternate livelihoods set up for those growing poppy, and a judicial system capable of taking down the drug barons. Until then, we should focus on the top of the food-chain, not the bottom.\nWe have three witnesses today who can explain these issues in detail, with authority and expertise. First, we have Richard Boucher the Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia. We all know and respect him as a straight shooter.\nNext we have Gen. James Jones who recently retired from the U.S. Marine Corps. Gen. Jones was the commander of NATO until early this year, and he supervised the Alliances expansion to include responsibility for all of Afghanistan. And then we have Ambassador James Dobbins, currently at the RAND Corporation, who has served as Special Envoy for Afghanistan. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, he served as liaison to the Afghan forces fighting alongside our troops to bring down the Taliban. Gentlemen welcome and Ill now turn it over to Sen. Lugar for his opening statement.\n",

    "text": "\nWilmington, DE - In his continued effort to change the course in Iraq, Senator Joe Biden today launched a new website www.EndingTheWar.com and online petition to support a new, binding resolution he co-authored with Senator Carl Levin (D-MI). The website allows visitors to read the text of the legislation and sign the online petition which enables them to voice their support of the joint resolution to Congress and the Bush Administration.\nIf passed, the legislation, would force the President to change the course in Iraq by requiring him to:\n\nTransition the forces in Iraq to a new, more limited mission of training Iraqis and denying terrorists a safe haven in Iraq;\n\n\nBegin the phased redeployment of forces from Iraq within four months;\n\n\nComplete the withdrawal of our combat forces by March 2008, except for a limited number necessary to carry out the limited mission.\n\nOpposing the surge is only a first step. We need a radical change in course in Iraq. If the President won't act, Congress will. Over the past three weeks, working with my friend Senator Carl Levin, I wrote a law to fundamentally revise U.S. policy in Iraq, said Sen. Biden. I am very pleased that Democrats are uniting behind the goals Senator Levin and I proposed. What I'm proposing is a plan to end the war in Iraq without leaving a mess behind. What the President proposes is no end in sight.\nBiden has been on the forefront of the effort to force the Bush Administration to change their failed policies in Iraq. Nearly a year ago, he, along with Foreign Relations President Emeritus Leslie H. Gelb offered a comprehensive political, diplomatic and economic strategy in Iraq to secure a political settlement. Then, early this year, as head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he chaired a month of hearings with expert panels to explore diplomatic, political and military strategies for dealing with the current situation. Since then, he has begun holding a series of Iraq Town Hall meetings around the country including one in Des Moines last Friday night.\nFor more information on the Iraq Town Hall meetings or Sen. Biden's plan, please visit: www.JoeBiden.com and www.PlanForIraq.com.\nContact: Annie Tomasini, 302-428-5427 or Press@JoeBiden.com.\n",

    "text": "\nSenator Calls for quick action on Senate Floor\nWashington, D.C. - The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee today unanimously approved legislation that would put an additional 50,000 police officers in neighborhoods and communities across America. Senator Joe Biden (D-DE), author of the 1994 Crime Law that is widely credited with helping to create the lowest crime rates in decades, has been pushing to get this legislation passed, particularly in light of recent FBI statistics that show a steady increase in violent crime.\nIn addition to putting additional officers on the streets, Biden's legislation also includes funding for the School Resource Officer program which is aimed at combating violence in schools.\n\"There can be no doubt that the COPS program was a success, said Senator Biden. But rather than continue on the path of success, the Bush Administration and Republican leadership have all but eliminated it, said Biden. Local law enforcement is facing what I have called a perfect storm. The FBI is changing the focus for its field agents from local crime to terrorism. Undoubtedly, this is necessary given the threats facing our nation. But, this means that there will be less federal assistance for violent crime, drug cases and bank robberies. Local law enforcement will be required to fill the gap left by the FBI in addition to performing more and more homeland security duties.\nBiden continued, Its time to right that wrong. We need to keep faith with our state and local law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line every day to keep our communities safe from crime and terrorism.\nMy colleagues on the Judiciary Committee have unanimously approved this bill. Recently, the Brookings Institution strongly advocated for a reauthorization of the COPS program, calling it one of the most cost-effective options available for fighting crime. They can see what is plainly obvious crime is like cutting grass and if you stop mowing the lawn, one day youll look outside and see a jungle. Were seeing very tall grass in our communities now, and we need to move this bill to the full Senate quickly, so can get local police agencies the help they so desperately need.\nSpecifically, Biden's legislation would:\n\nauthorize $600 million to hire officers to engage in community policing, counter-terrorism duties, and serve as school resource officers;\n\n\nprovide $350 million per year for technology grants allowing police agencies to purchase things like lap top computers for patrol cars and crime mapping software;\n\n\nprovide $200 million per year to help local district attorneys hire community prosecutors.\n\nSince 1994, the COPS program has funded 118,000 officers, leading to a 30 percent drop in violent crime. COPS funds can be used to hire community police officers and purchase new crime-fighting equipment for police departments. To date, Delaware has hired over 220 new community policing officers.\nThis legislation has been endorsed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Sheriffs Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Officers, the International Union of Police Associations, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the National League of Cities.\n",

    "text": "\nArmored Vehicles (MRAPS) Can Reduce Casualties from Road-side Bombs by Two-Thirds\nWashington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) called today for additional funding for armored vehicles to be included in the Iraq Supplemental. In a letter sent to Senator Robert C. Byrd, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Biden requested additional funding in the FY 2007 Supplemental Appropriations Bill to meet the militarys need for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles. Currently, 70 percent of casualties suffered by U.S. personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan result from roadside bombs, but the military has indicated that MRAP vehicles can reduce these casualties by two-thirds.\n[We must] get as many of these vehicles as possible into the field, as quickly as possible, to protect our troops, Sen. Biden wrote in the letter.\nSpecifically, the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force are in need of 7,774 vehicles, at a total cost of $8.4 billion. The Department of Defense believes it can optimize production by providing almost half the total funding in Fiscal Year 2007 and half in Fiscal Year 2008. Yet, there is only $2.3 billion in the 2007 Supplemental request for MRAPs -- $1.7 billion less than required to purchase approximately half of these badly-needed vehicles. By providing the additional $1.7 billion in this Supplemental, the military will be able to obtain 2,500 more vehicles by December 2007 and deploy them to Iraq and Afghanistan six months sooner.\nAs in the past, the Presidents funding request is inadequate to protect our troops in the field. Congress must provide adequate funds for such protection. I urge you to include the additional $1.7 billion in the Fiscal Year 2007 Supplemental so that the military can accelerate production and deployment to the optimal level,\" wrote Sen. Biden.\n",

    "text": "\nSen. Biden's Legislation to Fully Fund Successful COPS Program Passes Senate with Broad Bipartisan Support\nWashington, DC - Sen. Biden's amendment to the FY 2008 Budget Resolution to fully fund the successful COPS program passed the Senate today with broad, bi-partisan support. This will provide state and local law enforcement agencies with critical resources to hire community policing and school resource officers, and to purchase new technologies to aid law enforcement in preventing and responding to acts of crime and terrorism.\nCrime isnt a Democratic or a Republican issue it affects all of us, said Sen. Joe Biden. And Im very glad my colleagues from both sides of the aisle stood with me today to give our law enforcement officers the tools and resources they need to keep our neighborhoods safe.\nSenator Biden is the author of the 1994 Crime Law that is widely credited with helping to create the lowest crime rates in decades, and has been pushing to get this legislation passed, particularly in light of recent FBI statistics that show a steady increase in violent crime. Last summer the FBI released its 2005 Uniform Crime Reports and found that murders were up 3.4%. Also, the Police Executive Research Forum recently released an updated examination of crime numbers from 56 cities around the country. They examined the two year trends and found that total homicides were 10.6% higher in 2006 than they were in 2004. Homicide rates in major cities across America were even higher according to the study, which reported 20% increases in Baltimore, Charlotte, Charleston, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Newark, and Seattle, among others.\nI have been fighting for the COPS program for years because of its proven ability to reduce crime. In 1994 when we passed the Crime Bill, we had historically high rates of violent crimes. But because we put more cops on the streets, we were able to reduce these crimes to the lowest levels in a generation, added Sen. Biden.\nThe Brookings Institution published a policy briefing this month entitled, \"MORE COPS.\" The authors, Yale economist John Donohue, III and Georgetown economist Jens Ludwig state that the COPS program contributed to the drop in crime during the 1990s and is one of the most cost-effective options for fighting crime. The policy briefing states that each $1.4 billion invested in the COPS program is likely to generate a benefit to society from $6 billion to $12 billion.\n\"Even in the face of such proven success, the Bush Administration has all but eliminated the COPS program,\" said Senator Biden. \"Overall funding for state and local law enforcement programs has been slashed by billions and the COPS hiring program has been completely cut. And violent crime is up. It doesn't take much to figure out the connection - and it doesn't take much to know how to turn it around,\" added Sen. Biden.\nSince 1994, the COPS program has funded 118,000 officers, leading to a 30 percent drop in violent crime. COPS funds can be used to hire community police officers and purchase new crime fighting equipment for police departments. To date, Delaware has hired over 220 new community policing officers.\nWith the passage of Sen. Biden's Amendment, the Senate is on record fully funding the COPS program at $1.15 billion for FY 2008. The Senate Appropriations Committee will now determine specific allocations for funding. I urge my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to follow the lead of the full Senate in our commitment to law enforcement, added Sen. Biden.\n###\nSen. Joe Biden has dedicated his career to fighting crime and protecting families. He is the author of the historic 1994 Crime Bill which helped reduce crime nationwide by funding more than 100,000 police officers through the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program. In addition, Sen. Biden has pushed for the creation of a Homeland Security Trust Fund. This legislation would create a dedicated fund for the implementation of the 9/11 Commission recommendations, restoration of funding for local law enforcement and make other critical homeland security upgrades.\nTo read more of the Brookings Institution's policy brief on the COPS program, please visit The Brookings Institute.\n",

    "text": "\nResolution is First Legislation on Climate Change to Move out of Any Committee in 110th Congress\nWashington, D.C. - The Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) and Senator Richard Lugars (R-IN) bipartisan resolution (S.Res.30) calling for the United States to return to international negotiations on climate change. This is the first legislation on climate change to move out of any Committee in the 110th Congress.\nThe climate has changed. It has changed outside, where last year was the warmest on record in the United States. And the climate has changed in halls of the Senate, where the causes and consequences of global warming and how we should respond is a major concern of this new Congress, said Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Joe Biden.\nThe Biden-Lugar Resolution states that the evidence of the human role in global warming is clear, that the environmental, economic, and security effects will be costly, and that the response must be international. The resolution recognizes that there are real economic benefits both from reducing the waste and inefficiencies inherent in greenhouse gas emissions and from the markets for new, climate-friendly technologies. The Resolution calls for the United States to resume its role as leader in the international effort to address this global threat.\nThe resolution calls for United States participation in negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed by the first President Bush, to protect the economic and security interests of the United States, and to commit all nations developed and developing that are major emitters of greenhouse gases to achieve significant long-term reductions in those emissions. Most important, it puts the Senate on record, calling for the United States to resume its role as leader in the international effort to address this global threat. The resolution also calls for a bipartisan Senate observer group to monitor these talks and ensure that our negotiators bring back agreements that all Americans can support.\nFor too long we have abdicated the responsibility to reduce our own emissions, the largest single source of the problem we face today. We have the worlds largest economy, with the highest per capita emissions. Rather than leading by example, we have retreated from meaningful, binding, multilateral international negotiations. With this resolution, we want to put the Senate on record in support of a new effort to build trust, to make commitments, and to participate in a coordinated international effort to confront the real threat of climate change, said Senator Biden.\n",

    "text": "\nSince before our founding, the United States has been set apart by its uncompromising commitment to the rule of law and individual rights and civil liberties.\nThe values embodied in our constitutional government have been the pole star by which the world has set its moral compass.\nThey have given us the moral authority to lead our allies, and to defeat fascism and communism.\nIn the aftermath of September 11, as the world mourned with us, we had an opportunity to lead again.\nThe world looked to us to form a new coalition to face the threat of international terrorism and defend the very values the terrorists had attacked.\nRegrettably, the Bush Administration saw it differently.\nThe President accepted a Faustian bargain. He abandoned our uncompromising commitment to the rule of law and individual rights in the belief that it was the only way to secure the United States against the threat of terrorism.\nMy firm belief and absolute conviction is that this Faustian bargain has had the ironic effect of making us less safe, not more safe; emboldened terrorists, not dissuaded them, and diminished us in the eyes of our friends and allies.\nAs I said on September 11the terrorists win when we abandon our civil liberties.\nWe need not change our national character in order to defeat terrorism. As a matter of fact, we are already defeated by the terrorists if we change our character.\nAs a young Senator in 1977, I remember hearing Richard Nixon, who had resigned in disgrace less than three years earlier, comment on the President's duty to obey the law. He said: When the President does it that means that it is not illegal.\nHis statement was breathtaking in its disregard for the rule of law and our constitutional system of checks and balances, but I was convinced that this was the only time in my life I would hear a President defend his actions on the grounds that he was above the law.\n30 years later, here I am once again with a President claiming that because its a time of war our laws and traditions do not apply to him.\nI will address today five aspects of his policy that subvert our constitutional principles and make us less safe at home and weaker abroad: the acceptance of what amounts to torture, the practice of extraordinary rendition, the operation of secret prisons, the unwarranted surveillance of Americans, and the revocation of habeas corpus.\nI will argue that by redefining what constitutes torture, redefining international treaty obligations, and operating secret prisons, he has squandered the support of the world and the opportunity to lead it.\nAnd here at home the overly broad definition of inherent Presidential power in the time of war has undermined the basic civil liberties of American citizens.\nTorture\nHistorically, the United States has advocated outlawing torture. We played a central role in drafting the Geneva Conventions and negotiating the Convention Against Torture. And we have enacted domestic laws to severely punish those who torture.\nAnd with good reason beyond the obvious morale imperative.\nOur efforts to outlaw torture were designed to protect the hundreds of thousands of Americans soldiers overseas by giving us the moral authority to demand that those who are captured be treated humanely.\nAfter September 11, the President, for all intent and purpose, abandoned our historical opposition to torture. The sophistry engaged in by the Justice Department allowed his Administration to establish two new pillars of a policy regarding torture.\nThe first narrowed the definition of torture to conduct that causes serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.\nIt created a wide class of permissible mistreatment that though [it] might constitute cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment . . . failed to rise to the level of torture.\nThe second exempted the President, as Commander-in-Chief, from these laws and allowed him to use torture, even though illegal, if he deems it necessary.\nEmboldened by this analysis, the President allowed his Administration to engage in practices that the rest of the world regarded as torture but he had defined as permissible.\nA solider who recently served in Afghanistan and Iraq sent the following statement to a Senator: Some argue that since our actions are not as horrifying as Al Qaedas, we should not be concerned. When did Al Qaeda become any type of standard by which we measure the morality of the United States?\nWe are America, and our actions should be held to a higher standard. . . . I would rather die fighting than give up even the smallest part of the idea that is America.\nThe President's policy has damaged Americas image, alienated some of our closest partners, and given significant ammunition to the most extreme terrorists to attract new recruits.\nThe President's policy has also led to inexcusable blunders.\nThe Administration used information obtained from detained Al Qaeda members, who under coercion, asserted that Iraq had trained Al Qaeda operatives to make and use weapons of mass destruction.\nHe cited this information repeatedly to justify taking us to war in Iraq. This information, like almost all information that was coerced, was false. The source told his interrogators what they wanted to hear to stop the coercion.\nAnd as I said earlier, the President's policy has provided fodder to Al Qaedas propagandists and recruiters, who have broadcast images of the atrocities at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib around the world. Imagine if an American soldier were captured by Al Qaeda.\nNow --- what moral authority do we have now to demand that they treat our soldiers humanely?\nIts time for us to stop this behavior and comply with our international treaty obligations.\nI call upon the President today to comply with our domestic law and our international treaty obligations. Mr. President, the American people and the world have had enough of the equivocations and loop holes on this subject. It is time for you to state clearly that we will abide by our international obligations and our policy will reflect our national values.\nExtraordinary Rendition\nA policy of kidnapping a suspect and transporting him to a country that we know to use torture or secret site for interrogation is a practice called extraordinary rendition and historically been an anathema to our national values.\nAnd although there is a place in the war on terror for rendition to justice, where a suspect is sent to another country to face trial, the use of extraordinary rendition, or rendition to a country that we know uses torture, is out of bounds and counterproductive.\nAs one expert noted, [e]very country to which the United States has rendered a terrorism suspect since 9/11 has been [recognized by the State Department as] a persistent and egregious violator of human rights.\nTo add insult to injury, the President has claimed that his authority as Commander-in-Chief includes the power to order extraordinary rendition and that such an order is not subject to review by our courts or oversight by Congress.\nThe President's abuse of rendition has diminished our moral stature and sapped popular support for the United States around the world, making it difficult to get from foreign partners the cooperation and intelligence we need to effectively fight terrorism.\nShortly after Italy indicted 25 CIA agents for a 2003 rendition, Italian citizens took to the streets to protest the expansion of an American military base.\nA Canadian Government commission censured the United States and Canada has been reticent to share intelligence with us ever since. Germany issued arrest warrants for 13 CIA agents.\nAnd Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and the Council of Europe are all investigating U.S. renditions within their jurisdictions.\nThere is also strong evidence that the Administrations policy has strengthened the position of oppressive and anti-democratic security services in countries like Syria and Egypt.\nIf our own security services engage in extra-legal kidnapping, detention, and mistreatment, how can we criticize foreign security services that use the same tactics to suppress democratic reform?\nAs President, I will stop this practice.\nSecret Prisons\nSome of those rendered are not turned over to brutal foreign regimes, but are held by American security services in secret prisons or black sites. The President has attempted to hide these facilities from the American people and from the world.\nTo ensure that his actions were once again beyond the reach of U.S. law, the President has located these facilities abroad.\nLegal experts have opined, however, that these prisons often violate the laws of the countries in which they are located.\nAnd after press coverage has sparked outrage, the President has been forced to close several of them.\nSome who have been released from black sites and several international human rights organizations have alleged that the CIA uses brutal techniques at these sites, including waterboarding.\nWhat kind of example are we setting for the world with such base behavior?\nThe President has guarded this secret prison system so closely we still know little about it. The President only disclosed the existence of the black site program after the press broke the story.\nAs the existence of these black sites, and the techniques used in them have become known, they have become one of Al Qaedas most effective recruiting tools.\nAccording to unclassified reporting on last years National Intelligence Estimate, the abuses that occur at these secret prisons and at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay have stoked the jihad movement.\nMr. President, the American people are tired of half-truths. Close the black sites that are a black stain on the name of America, and close Guantanamo and bulldoze Abu Ghraib to the ground.\nWarrantless Wiretapping & National Security Letters\nThe President's misguided policy of attempting to protect America by violating our fundamental notions of constitutional governance and individual rights and liberties has not been confined to actions abroad.\nThe President has also engaged in such practices here at home, including his notorious warrantless wiretapping program and his abuse of authority under the Patriot Act.\nHe has secretly eavesdropped on Americans without Congressional authorization or a judicial approval. We fought the American Revolution in part to free ourselves of intrusions on our privacy without probably cause.\nThe Fourth Amendment guarantees freedom from unreasonable government searches and seizures and permits a judge to issue a warrant only after finding probable cause.\nIt stands as a bulwark against arbitrary government invasions of our privacy, and the President is bound by it even as we fight terrorism.\nPresident Bush appears to have no patience for the Fourth Amendment and a caviler of Americans rights and liberties.\nWe wont defeat terrorism by destroying the Bill of Rights.\nIn 1928 Justice Brandeis warned that other instruments of executive power were but puny instruments of tyranny and oppression when compared with wire tapping. Justice Holmes described wiretapping as a dirty business. They were prescient.\nIn 1976, a Senate Committee chaired by Frank Church uncovered shocking civil liberties abuses that had occurred during decades of extra-legal surveillance.\nTo ensure that this would never happen again, the Church Committee recommended reforms. In 1978, as a member of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, I helped fashion the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which enacted many of the Committees recommendations. Ninety-four colleagues from both sides of the aisle voted to pass FISA.\nFISA ensured that the President retained the necessary tools to protect national security and collect foreign intelligence without violating Americans civil liberties. In other words, we created a framework for protecting national security and Americans privacy.\nFISA established a court that could examine classified evidence and issue wiretap orders. We tailored the standard for FISA wiretaps to the national security threat. Instead of showing probable cause, FISA required the government to show that the subject of the warrant was a suspected terrorist or spy.\nTo ensure national security, we included exceptions: one allows the President to wiretap a terrorist suspect in an emergency prior to obtaining a warrant, as long as he obtains a warrant within\n72 hours, and a second suspends the warrant requirement for 15 days after a Congressional declaration of war.\nWe also took pains to make clear FISA was the exclusive means by which the President could conduct national security surveillance; FISA unambiguously prohibits all such surveillance not authorized by statute.\nI have argued from the beginning that the President could conduct surveillance of suspected terrorists while complying with FISA.\nHe has chosen instead to ignore FISAs clear prohibition on warrantless surveillance, arguing that he has inherent constitutional authority to conduct surveillance for national security purposes.\nBy so doing, he has knowingly and willfully violated the law and Americans privacy, offering the same arrogant justification as President Nixon that he is above the law.\nIt was only after the Democratic Party regained control of Congress that the Administration reluctantly subjected its surveillance program to FISA court review.\nThrough strong congressional oversight, we need to ensure that the FISA court retains jurisdiction over all the President's surveillance programs. And folks, a clear lesson can be drawn from this elections matter!\nThe President has also abused the authority Congress gave him under the PATRIOT Act to issue National Security Letters. FBI officials issue these letters without judicial review to demand sensitive financial, credit, phone, and Internet records. Last month, a Congressionally mandated audit revealed that the FBI has made frequent errors in its use of National Security Letters, sometimes getting information about the wrong people and sometimes getting information its not entitled to under the statute.\nA Biden administration would fight terrorism without destroying the very values were fighting to preserve. I would require a United States Attorney to approve the use of National Security Letters, to ensure that the government gets the information it needs without sacrificing our privacy.\nDepriving Terror Detainees of Habeas Corpus\nContinuing with his assault on individual rights and liberties in the name of national security, the President has also deprived terrorism detainees of the most cherished right in our constitutional system habeas corpus. Habeas corpus is a Latin term, meaning to render the body.\nIt was conceived to prevent someone from being locked up erroneously or illegally, with no chance to contest his imprisonment. But lets be clear: It is not a get out of jail free card. And it will not result in the release of dangerous terrorists.\nHabeas corpus is a judicial safeguard that predates our constitutional democracy.\nIt was among British subjects chief demands of King John on the field at Runnymede in 1215, as reflected in the Magna Carta. Alexander Hamilton described habeas corpus in the Federalist Papers as among the greatest securities to liberty and republicanism that the Constitution contains.\nWhile the Framers relegated most individual rights to subsequent amendments in the Bill of Rights, they included habeas corpus in the body of the Constitution itself.\nIn a war where many of our detainees were not captured on a battlefield by U.S. forces and were not wearing military uniforms, habeas corpus is an indispensable safeguard against erroneous detention.\nBut perhaps most importantly, habeas corpus ensures that if the United States detains someone, it does so with full respect for the Constitution and the rule of law.\nThe President has nonetheless stripped detainees of this fundamental safeguard.\nHis efforts to deprive detainees of habeas have been repudiated three times by a Supreme Court dominated by Republican nominees. But still he persists.\nAs a result, nations around the world view Guantanamo not as a facility necessitated by the war on terror, but as a symbol of American disregard for the rule of law.\nOur enemies have used it and Abu Ghraib to recruit additional terrorists.

We should immediately move to restore habeas and, as I have said before, we should shut Guantanamo down.\nConclusion\nThe President responded to September 11, in an effort to make us safer, by cutting deeply into Americans most cherished rights and liberties and running roughshod over constitutional limitations on Presidential power.\nBut as the Supreme Court recently held, a state of war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nations citizens.\nThe President's irresponsible use of power is inexcusable. It is time for Congress to re-assert our constitutional role, and exercise strict oversight over the President's policies.\nIt is time to reestablish our moral stature in the world and mend our most important foreign relationships. It is time to send a clear message to our citizens, to our men and women in uniform, and to people around the world, that we are a nation of laws and not men.\nThat we do not choose between security and liberty, we demand both. That we neither condone torture, nor kidnap people and send them to other countries to be tortured.\nSending this message will be the first step toward restoring our constitutional balance, reaffirming our individual rights and liberties, and renewing our moral leadership in the world.\n",

    "text": "\nIt is time to reestablish our moral stature in the world\nDes Moines, IA - In a speech before the American Constitution Society at the Drake University School of Law, Sen. Joe Biden today condemned the Bush Administrations cavalier attitude toward individual rights and liberties and warned that the Bush Administrations abuse of power has made us less secure, led to the alienation of our key foreign partners, undermined our constitutional balance of power and weakened our national security.\nBy abandoning these fundamental values, the President has squandered the opportunity to unite and lead the world and made us less safe from both tyranny and terrorism, said Biden. Today, I call on him to reform these policies in order to restore our constitutional balance, reaffirm our individual rights and liberties, and renew our moral leadership in the world.\nBiden says the time is now to rein these policies back in, restore our constitutional balance, reaffirm our commitment to individual rights and liberties and renew our moral leadership in the world.\n\"It is time to send a clear message to our citizens, to our men and women in uniform, and to people around the world,\" said Biden. We are a nation of laws and not men, and that we do not choose between security and liberty, we demand both.\"\nBelow is an abstract of Sen. Biden's speech today. You can find the remarks as prepared for delivery by clicking here.\n###\nAbstract of Sen. Joe Biden's Address\nDrake University School of Law\nApril 3, 2007\nOverview\nOur commitment to the rule of law, balanced constitutional government, and individual rights and liberties has always defined the United States and set us apart on the world stage. After September 11, the Bush Administration believed it was necessary to sacrifice these fundamental values to improve national security. It promulgated policies with respect to torture, extraordinary rendition, secret prisons, warrantless wiretapping, and habeas corpus for terrorism detainees that rejected the rule of law, disrupted the constitutional balance of power between the branches of government, and subverted individual rights and liberties.\nThe result, predictably, has not been to make us safer at home or stronger abroad. Our strength as a world leader has always derived from our refusal to compromise our fundamental values. Americans don't choose between security and liberty, we demand both. By abandoning these values, the President has squandered the opportunity to unite and lead the world and made us less safe from both tyranny and terrorism. Today, I call on him to reform these policies in order to restore our constitutional balance, reaffirm our individual rights and liberties, and renew our moral leadership in the world.\nOn Torture\nThe United States was a chief architect of the international conventions outlawing torture. Our domestic law, too, strictly prohibits torture and severely punishes those who engage in it. In the now-infamous torture memo, however, the Administration permitted techniques the rest of the world regards as torture and allowed the President, as Commander-in-Chief, to use torture in the name of national security.\nOn this topic, Senator Biden stated that the American people and the world have had enough of the equivocations and loop holes and called on the President to comply with our domestic law and our international treaty obligations.\nOn Extraordinary Rendition\nThe President has instituted a practice, called extraordinary rendition, of kidnapping terrorism suspects and transporting them to secret prisons or foreign countries. According to the State Department, the countries to which the President renders these individuals consistently subject prisoners to brutal torture. Foreign partners have charged criminally more than 35 American personnel for their roles in extraordinary renditions. Although rendition to justice, in which a suspect is transported to a jurisdiction where he receives a fair trial, may be justified in some circumstances, rendition to torture is never justified.\nThe Presidents abuse of rendition has diminished our moral stature and sapped popular support for the United States around the world, making it difficult to get from foreign partners the cooperation and intelligence we need to effectively fight terrorism.\nOn Secret Prisons or Black Sites\nThe President has operated a system of secret prisons where terrorism suspects are brutally mistreated. He has concealed these facilities from the American public and the international community and claimed that they are not subject to any law. Although little is known about these black sites and the President has resisted Congressional oversight, international organizations report that several black site detainees have been killed.\nIn making his case that these secret prisons must be closed, Senator Biden cited the National Intelligence Estimate and stated: According to unclassified reporting on last years National Intelligence Estimate, the abuses that occur at these secret prisons and at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay have stoked the jihad movement. Senator Biden went on to call on the President to cooperate with Congress, to disclose the details of your [President Bush] secret prison program.\nOn Warrantless Wiretapping\nThe President has ignored clear provisions of United States law that require him to obtain a court order before spying on Americans e-mails and conversations. His Administration has also used National Security Letters to obtain Americans sensitive financial, phone, and Internet records without complying with procedural safeguards that protect Americans privacy. He has reluctantly complied with the wiretapping law only in response to public outrage and an unmistakable rebuke in the mid-term elections.\nSenator Biden said that he would fight terrorism without destroying the very values were fighting to preserve. I would require a United States Attorney to approve the use of National Security Letters, to ensure that the government gets the information it needs without sacrificing our privacy.\nOn Habeas Corpus\nThe President has argued that habeas corpus, our principal constitutional safeguard against erroneous or illegal imprisonment, is unavailable to terrorism detainees in U.S. custody. The Supreme Court, dominated by Republican nominees, has rejected the Presidents argument on three separate occasions.\nHis efforts to deprive detainees of habeas have been repudiated three times by a Supreme Court dominated by Republican nominees. But still he persists.\nAs a result, nations around the world view Guantanamo not as a facility necessitated by the war on terror, but as a symbol of American disregard for the rule of law.\nOur enemies have used it and Abu Ghraib to recruit additional terrorists. These prisons have become symbols of American duplicity, not beacons of American justice.\nWe should not wait for another Supreme Court decision. We should immediately move to restore habeas and, as I have said before, we should shut Guantanamo down.\nConclusion\nThe Presidents policies in these five areas have betrayed our national values, alienated foreign partners, and fueled al Qaeda recruitment. We will not be secure at home and respected abroad until we right these wrongs. It is time to reestablish the rule of law, restore our constitutional system of checks and balances, and reaffirm our individual rights and liberties. Only then can the United States once again lead the world effectively and defeat international terrorism.\n",

We also voted to do what the majority of Americans expect: to start bringing the war in Iraq to an end responsibly, not escalate it and keep it going indefinitely.\n\"If the President carries through with his threat to veto the emergency spending bill Congress sends him, he's the one who will deny our troops funding and he's the one who will be out of touch with the American people and with America's interests. It's also beyond outrageous that the President accuses Democrats of \"undercutting\" our troops.\n\"Here's what has already \"undercut\" our troops: Going to war unnecessarily, with no plan, without enough troops, without the right protective gear for the troops we sent or the right care for those that came home.\n\"Here's what will undercut them going forward if we don't start bringing this war to end responsibly: sending soldiers back to Iraq on 3rd, 4th and 5th tours, extending deployments from 6 to 12 months for our Marines and from 12 months to 16 or 18 months for the Army, ending the practice of giving our troops a year at home between deployments, and continuing the back-door draft of decommissioned soldiers.\n\"I can't think of a President who has done more damage to our military. He's caused a readiness crisis and if we don't change course in Iraq, we're heading toward a recruitment and retention crisis.\n\"A President's first responsibility is to our men and women in uniform. If the President vetoes the money for our troops in Iraq, he will again fail that responsibility.\"\n",

He also ran the Gore campaigns operation in Nevada in 2000 and prior to that served as the DNCs Director of Organizing and Training.\nIn the years before joining the AFL-CIO, where she served as their PAC coordinator, Wambu served in various key roles on numerous local and statewide races. Most recently, she provided political and fundraising services to a number of incumbent members of Congress across the country. She also worked for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during the 00 and 98 cycles.\nOwens, a lawyer and the daughter of Biden's sister and long-time campaign manager, Valerie Biden-Owens, brings a lifetime of political experience to the campaign.

The military will also be forced to end the practice of keeping troops at home for at least a year between deployments; forced to fully mobilize the National Guard and Reserve; and forced to perpetuate a backdoor draft. We don't have to guess at the impact on readiness, recruitment and retention. Just today, we also learned that recent graduates of West Point are choosing to leave active duty service at the highest rate in more than three decades. This administration's policies are literally driving out some of our best young officers.

    "text": "\nWashington, DC - A resolution introduced this week by Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) to commemorate Yom Hashoah - Holocaust Memorial Day (April 15, 2007) - and calling for the Bad Arolsen Nazi archives to be made public, passed the Senate today unanimously. The Bad Arolsen archives contain between 30 and 50 million pages, penned by the Nazis themselves, which chronicle the individual fates of more than 17 million victims of Nazi persecution. Thousands of Holocaust survivors, historians, and researchers, however, are still being denied access to these files and archives.\n\"It is important for the United States Senate to stand unanimously with communities the world over in marking Yom Hashoah,\" said Sen. Biden. \"It is also important to stand unanimously and ask: more than 60 years after the end of World War II, why is it still so hard to access files documenting the Nazis' atrocious acts? As we mourn the millions who were lost at the hands of the Nazis this week, how can we deny these victims - who have suffered enough for a thousand lifetimes - the truth they so clearly deserve? Thousands of elderly survivors have passed away in recent years, never knowing what happened to their families, even though the answer may be sitting on a shelf in Germany. This is simply tragic and demands immediate action. I commend my colleagues for their support of this resolution.\"\nAfter the Allies won the war, they took possession of millions of files and documents which detailed individual atrocities committed by the Nazis. To maintain this catalogue, the Allies established an archive called the International Tracing Service, in the town of Bad Arolsen, Germany. This Tracing Service was established to unify families and help survivors learn the ultimate fate of their lost loved ones. Yet, access to the records is severely limited, and very few survivors have ever been allowed direct, much less prompt, access.\nEleven countries serve on the International Commission that supervises the Tracing Service. Last May, after years of delay, they agreed to make these archives public for the first time. They also agreed to place digitized copies at Holocaust research centers in other countries, but only after each of the 11 countries - the United States, Israel, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, and the United Kingdom - completed their own ratification procedure. In light of the advanced age of the remaining survivors, all committed to make ratification an urgent priority, with the goal of concluding the process by the end of 2006.\nSen. Biden has long been an advocate of opening up the Bad Arolsen archives. Troubled by ongoing and needless delays, in December 2006, Sen. Biden wrote to the ambassadors of the nine Tracing Service Commission countries that had not completed ratification. Sen. Biden urged those countries - Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and the United Kingdom - to swiftly ratify the agreement to open the archives. Since the time Sen. Biden penned the letters, the United Kingdom, Poland, and the Netherlands have joined the United States and Israel in completing ratification. However, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy and Luxembourg have not done so.\nSen. Biden's resolution: 1) Commemorates Yom Hashoah, Holocaust Memorial Day; 2) Commends the countries that have completed ratification of the agreement to make the Bad Arolsen archives public 3) Calls on those countries yet to complete ratification to do so immediately; and 4) Calls on the International Commission to approve immediate distribution of electronic copies of the documents from Bad Arolsen to research centers around the world, including the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, so that survivors will be able to document their experience, and learn the fates of their lost loved ones.\n",

Joe Biden published an op-ed in the Washington Post (The Real Surge Story, op-ed April 12) which strongly critiques Sen. John McCains proposal to continue seeking military victory in Iraq and his mistaken belief that there can be a strong central government in Baghdad.\nThere is no military solution in Iraq, said Sen. Biden. I have great respect for John he truly has the courage of his convictions. But it is my conviction that he is dead wrong on this. The Bush-Cheney plan is doomed to fail, and Sen. McCain is making that failure worse by his support for this failed policy.\nIn his Post piece, Biden argued that McCains claim that the president's strategy is showing results - but that most Americans don't know it because the media covers just the bad news in Iraq - is just wrong. As Biden points out, the reality is that for every welcome development, there is an equally or even more unwelcome development that gives lie to the claim that we are making progress.\nSen. Biden believes that a political solution is the only option we have left in order to bring our troops home without leaving chaos behind. Iraq must make the transition to a decentralized, federal system, as called for in its constitution, where each major group has local control over the fabric of its daily life, including security, education, religion and marriage.\nIn response to Sen. McCains speech yesterday at Virgina Military Institute (VMI), the Biden campaign has added video of McCain to its www.HeadtoHead08.com website, launched last week.\nVisitors to the website will have the opportunity to clearly contrast Biden's substantive 5-point plan for a political solution in Iraq against Sen. McCains call for military escalation and continued insistence that the battle against terrorism justifies the Presidents failed policy.\nTo view the McCain-Biden page, go to www.HeadtoHead08.com.\n",

    "text": "\nConcord, NH - Sen. Joe Biden today called on President Bush to end the U.S. policy condoning torture, and condemned the Bush Administration for its blatant disregard of international treaties and constitutional safeguards.\nEmerging from a meeting with 13 former U.S. Generals organized by Human Rights First in Concord NH, Sen. Biden said As the Generals told me today, the policies of the Bush Administration are making our soldiers less safe. The selfless effort of these Generals to shed light on the travesty of this policy cannot go unnoticed.\nSen. Biden delivered a speech on the deterioration of civil liberties under the Bush Administration on April 3rd at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.\nAs I said in my speech and as I told the Generals today, there are four reasons to reverse the policies President Bush and Attorney General Gonzales have put in place:\n\nFirst, to protect our own forces from torture during detention.\n\n\nSecond, because we have more troops abroad that any other nation.\n\n\nThird, as the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) stated, our conduct spurs more terror than it stops.\n\n\nAnd fourth, because America must lead the world through the demonstration of our ideals and values.\n\nSen. Biden added These Generals are men who led our country in war and peace. Their courage in standing up for their troops must be recognized. Our soldiers should not be made targets for uncivilized behavior that others can somehow say we condone. We must reverse these policies now before another American serviceman or servicewoman is put at risk.\nTo read a copy of Sen.

Joe Biden a \"steady foe\" of the Yucca Mountain Project, the proposed burial site for nuclear waste in the Nevada desert. (\"Proposed Nuclear Waste Site Could Be Toxic Issue for Some Candidates\" April 15). This piece highlights the clear and steady position that Sen. Biden holds as it relates to this important debate and begins to examine some of the conflicting views of his Democratic opponents.\n\"I oppose Yucca Mountain. There are serious questions about the impact of using it as a repository of radioactive waste,\" said Sen. Biden. Stressing that there needs to be a greater focus on science and technology, Sen. Biden went on to say, \"I agree with Senator Reid that our focus on resolving this issue should be on science -- research and development of technology that allows plants to recycle waste or doesn't create that kind of waste in the first place.\"\nIllustrating Sen. Biden's consistent opposition to Yucca Mountain, the Washington Post highlights two quotes from Sen. Biden:\n\"I have serious concerns not only about the long-term environmental and security problemsbut the very real dangers posed by shipping 77,000 tons of high-level nuclear waste through at least 43 states.\" (News release, July 9th, 2002) and now \"I've been deeply involved with Yucca Mountain over the years.\" (Las Vegas Sun, March 23).\nSen.

    "text": "\n\"Biden: No More Threats, We need to Act Now\"\nWashington, DC - U.S. Senator Joe Biden, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today called immediate intervention in Darfur \"a moral obligation\" and argued that financial sanctions against the Khartoum government are long overdue.\nSenator Biden made his remarks after a speech in which President Bush was expected to announce additional sanctions against the Sudanese government, instead offering another chance to abide by U.N. sanctions.\n\"It's been nearly four years since the Bush Administration rightly called the atrocities in Darfur genocide -- and we are still making threats instead of taking action,\"said Senator Biden.\n\"Earlier this week Sudanese president, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan al-Bashir promised to accept the initial deployment of properly-equipped U.N. peacekeepers. But the Khartoum regime has a long history of broken promises: just yesterday, the U.N. released a report detailing-- in words and photos-- Khartoum's transport of arms and heavy military gear to Darfur, in blatant violation of Security Council resolutions. The Sudanese regime appears even to have painted its planes to resemble U.N. craft, in a bold attempt to disguise its actions.\n\"Today, President Bush pledged to levy financial sanctions on Khartoum if the regime again breaks its word. I have little faith Bashir will keep his promise. He will just keep stringing us along. Instead of more threats, we need to act, now.\n\"First, the U.N. report makes clear why implementing and enforcing the No Fly Zone over Darfur that I've been calling for since 2004 is more urgent than ever. We must stop Khartoum from aiding and abetting the slaughter from the skies. We have the means to do so. I recognize that a No Fly Zone could make it harder for humanitarian groups to perform their extraordinary work, so we should take their concerns into account. But we should do it, now.\n\"Second, we should set a deadline for Khartoum to accept the full U.N. peacekeeping force. If Khartoum fails to meet the deadline, we should impose the force. I am convinced that a small number of troops could make a huge difference in stopping the violence.\n\"Finally, we have to recognize that even if we stop the violence, it will come back unless we secure a lasting political settlement in Darfur. Khartoum and its Janjaweed militia are by far the biggest part of the problem. But the rebel groups must step up to their responsibility, present a common negotiating front and negotiate in good faith. We should launch a major diplomatic offensive to bring all the parties to the table.\n\"Over the past four years, as many as 400,000 people have died in the 21st century's first genocide. Millions more remain on the very edge of death, trapped in camps along the Chadian border. At a Foreign Relations Committee hearing on April 11, I made a prediction that I sincerely hope will not come true. I said that in five or ten years, we'll be asking ourselves why we didn't do everything we could to stop this genocide-- before it takes hundreds of thousands more lives. We'll be talking about a Hotel Darfur as well as a Hotel Rwanda.\n\"We have a moral obligation, and it's very simple: Stop the genocide-- now.\"\n",

Biden, Jr. (D-DE) issued the following statement today after the U.S. Senate passed the Emergency Supplemental Funding Bill for Iraq:\n\"President Bush has spent the last two weeks talking up the \"progress\" we're making in Iraq and talking down the Democrats and some of our Republican colleagues for trying to bring this war to a responsible end. But sometimes, you have to deal with the facts as they are - not as the President wants them to be.\n\"The president argues that the surge is succeeding. But for every welcome development he cites, there is an equally or even more \"unwelcome development\" that gives lie to the claim we are truly making progress. While death squad violence is down in some Baghdad neighborhoods, suicide bombings are up 30%. The civilian death toll has increased 15% from February to March. And violence is up dramatically in the belt ringing Baghdad. When we squeeze the water balloon in one place - it bulges somewhere else.\n\"The surge is not succeeding - but the President refuses to see that. And its purpose - to buy time for a strong central government to get its act together - is a dead end. There is no prospect the Iraqi people will rally behind the Maliki government. The basic premise of the president's policy is fundamentally and fatally flawed.\n\"We have to change course. We have to end this war responsibly and push for a political settlement that brings stability to Iraq. That is what Congress wants to do. Both the House and Senate have now passed the Emergency Supplemental Funding Bill for Iraq. This bill provides every dollar our troops need and the President requested - and then some.\n\"It also provides what the majority of Americans expect: a plan to start to bring our troops home and bring this war to a responsible end, not escalate it indefinitely. If the President vetoes the emergency spending bill, he's the one who will be denying our troops funding and he's the one who will be denying the American people a path out of Iraq. I hope the President will reconsider his veto threat and start working with Democrats and Congress on a way forward.\n\"My responsibility as a Senator is to keep relentless pressure on the President to come to grips with reality. To continually push every single day. To convince our Republican colleagues that it's time to stop backing the President and start backing the troops.\n\"With Les Gelb, I put forth my own plan to bring stability to Iraq a year ago. We advocate separating the warring parties - the Sunnis, Shia and Kurds - giving them breathing room in their own region, unified by a limited central government. History suggests that this is only peaceful way to keep together a country riven with sectarian strife. It is the only chance - as I see it - to achieve the objective most Americans share: to leave Iraq without leaving chaos behind.\n\"I can't guarantee that my strategy will work. But I can guarantee that the road the President has us on leads nowhere, with no end in sight .\"\n",

    "text": "\nRUSSERT: Welcome, Senator Biden, to our Meet the Candidates series.\nBIDEN: Good to be back.\nRUSSERT: Let me start with the vote in the Senate on Thursday. And here's how it was reported: \"The Senate approved $124 billion Iraq war spending bill that would force troop withdrawals to begin as early as July 1.\n\"The 51-to-46 vote was a triumph for Democrats, who just weeks ago worried about the political wisdom of a veto showdown with the commander in chief as troops fight on the battlefield. But Democrats are hesitant no more.\"\nWhy did you vote for a bill that had a timetable for withdrawal?\nBIDEN: That language is actually the language that I–that Carl Levin and I drafted, which said that, \"Mr. President, you got to start moving combat troops out of harm's way now.\" The whole function of this is to try to get this president to change his strategy. He operates on the premise that, if we put enough troops in the middle of a civil war, we can give breeding room to a group of people in Baghdad to get together and form a strong central government that's a democracy. That will not happen in your lifetime or mine. I said that four years ago; I say it now. The only rational purpose for troops in Iraq now: train Iraqis, prevent al-Qaeda from occupying large chunks of territory. and we should begin to decentralize the government. That's the underlying essence of what the language in this bill is about. It says, though, start now to redeploy and have as a target to get out by April 1st the bulk of the combat troops. I strongly subscribe to that view.\nRUSSERT: When you were here in January, I asked you about some of these steps, and this is how you responded. Let's watch.\n(Videotape, January 7, 2007)\nSEN. BIDEN: I think it is unconstitutional to say we're going to tell you, \"You can go, but we're going to micromanage the war.\" When we wrote the Constitution, the intention was to give the commander in chief the authority how to use the forces when you authorize him to be able to use the forces.\n(End videotape)\nRUSSERT: Aren't you now micromanaging?\nBIDEN: Not at all. Did you hear what I said? I said \"how to use the forces.\" We have authority to tell him how to use the forces. If you get in there, though, and once you tell him–we have, we have a responsibility to tell him what the mission is. He does not have the authority to engage in a mission of the use of our force in a country or out of a country that we do not authorize. And that's the thrust of what we're trying to do here. We're trying to fundamentally change what this president is using our forces for. He's in the midst of a civil war with the objective of–a flawed objective of establishing a strong central government. That will not happen, and we have an obligation to push back as much and as often and as thoroughly as we can.\nRUSSERT: But, senator, there has been an evolution in your thinking because this is what you said in–to the Brookings Institution in '05. \"We can\" tell it–\"We can call it quits and withdraw [from Iraq]. I think that would be a gigantic mistake. Or we can set a deadline for pulling out, which I fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out–equally a mistake.\" You're now setting a deadline.\nBIDEN: No, we're not setting a deadline. Read what it says. It says the target date, left up to the generals to determine whether or not it is appropriate to withdraw all forces.\nRUSSERT: Well, a target date is setting a deadline.\nBIDEN: No, no, but it leaves forces behind. We're trying to change the mission, Tim. The mission is all of us have been arguing one exception, in both parties, that you're going to have to leave forces behind in Iraq while this new government–if we actually get one up and running–is trying to function and trying to set up. The–look, the problem here is this is also a moving target. I also called for more troops in Iraq. I called for more troops on this program a couple years ago. That was in order to stop a civil war. Once the civil war began I was on the program after that saying all the troops in the world cannot settle a civil war. So what I'm having to respond to, like everyone else, is the president's initiatives and his failures that, that required difference circumstances and different answers at different times. But the fundamental principle's the same: We have an obligation to tell the president of the United States if we disagree with the mission for which he's using American forces. And the mission that he has us on is to settle a civil war through establishing a central democratic government in Baghdad. That mission is strategically flawed.\nRUSSERT: But you no longer have a problem setting a date for withdrawal.\nBIDEN: I no longer have a problem setting a target, a target that is flexible. There is no–there's nothing in it says that every troop has to be out on April the 1st.\nRUSSERT: You said this back in October of '02: \"We must be clear with the American people that we are committing to Iraq for the long haul; not just the day after, but the decade after.\" Do you believe we'll be in Iraq for a decade?\nBIDEN: I said back then, before we went to war, I wrote a report saying the decade after, and everyone was talking about the day after. And the point I was making was, if you went in and used force, which he should not have done when he did it, that we were committing and signing on to a decade. That was the–that was the minimum requirement. I also pointed out we needed more troops. I also pointed out at that time we would not be greeted with open arms. I also pointed out at that time oil would not pay for this. It was a warning, a warning to the president. \"Mr. President, the objective of us giving you this authority is to get inspectors back in, bring the pressure of the world community–which remember, at the time, when we were sitting here talking about this, the–at that moment the issue was are we going to pull out of–are we going to lift sanctions on Iraq or are we going to put more sanctions on Iraq? That, that was the context in which that debate was taking place.\nRUSSERT: So when some of your opponents in the Democratic primary say there will be no residual force left in Iraq?\nBIDEN: They are mistaken. They are making a mistake that is not practical. I don't know how that can work.\nRUSSERT: Senator Reid, the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Senator Feingold, the senator from Wisconsin, have joined together and introduced a bill, and here's the operative language: \"No funds appropriated or otherwise made available under any provision of law may be obligated or expended to continue the deployment in Iraq after March\" 31st, \"2008.\" Do you support that?\nBIDEN: No.\nRUSSERT: Why?\nBIDEN: For the reasons I just stated. I think it's–may–we may end–look, Tim, here's where we may end up. This president may so–make it so difficult to reach the objective, the only reasonable one I think's available, which is to leave Iraq, leaving behind a country secure within its own borders, not a threat to its neighbors, that is a loosely federated republic. It may get so bad that we do not have that option, and all of the option we have available to us is to withdraw and try to contain the civil war inside Iraq. We are not there yet. And until we reach that point, I am not prepared to say there are no circumstances under which, after a date certain, we would not have a single troop inside of Iraq.\nRUSSERT: So you will not vote to cut off funding for the war, period.\nBIDEN: No, that's not what I said. I just got finished telling you what I said, which was if, in fact, this president changes the circumstances again, where there lose all prospect of being able to achieve the goal that I've just set out, which I think could be achieved if we decentralize power in Iraq, if we have a limited federal government in Iraq, where we train the army, where they have control of the borders and their currency, where we give control over the fabric of the daily lives of the various warring factions–including their local police forces–their laws relating to marriage, divorce, the things they're killing each other over, if we get to the point where that is no longer an option and the place has totally disintegrated–which it may–that's a different circumstance. You can't–I don't know anyone who can say–I speak for myself. I cannot say for–with absolute certainty what I will do on every potential contingency because I have no control over this president's foreign policy and the direction he's taking us in Iraq.\nRUSSERT: But as of today, you would not vote to cut off...\nBIDEN: As of today, I would not vote to cut off all funding if the funding cutoff said there can be absolutely not a single solitary American force left anywhere within Iraq within a time certain.\nRUSSERT: I want to go back to 2002, because it's important as to what people were saying then and what the American people were hearing. Here's Joe Biden about Saddam Hussein: \"He's a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security.\"\n\"We have no choice but to eliminate the threat. This is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world.\"\n\"He must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power.\" You were emphatic about that.\nBIDEN: That's right, and I was correct about that. He must be, in fact–and remember the weapons we were talking about. I also said on your show, that's part of what I said, but not all of what I meant. What I also said on your show at the time was that I did not think he had weaponized his material, but he did have. When, when the inspectors left after Saddam kicked them out, there was a cataloguing at the United Nations saying he had X tons of, X amount of, and they listed the various materials he had. The big issue, remember, on this show we talked about, was whether he had weaponized them. Remember you asked me about those flights that were taking place in southern Iraq, where–were they spraying anthrax? And, you know, what would happen? And, you know, so on and so forth. And I pointed out to you that they had not developed that capacity at all. But he did have these stockpiles everywhere.\nRUSSERT: Where are they?\nBIDEN: Well, the point is, it turned out they didn't, but everyone in the world thought he had them. The weapons inspectors said he had them. He catalogued–they catalogued them. This was not some, some Cheney, you know, pipe dream. This was, in fact, catalogued. They looked at them and catalogued. What he did with them, who knows? The real mystery is, if he, if he didn't have any of them left, why didn't he say so? Well, a lot of people say if he had said that, he would've, you know, emboldened Iran and so on and so forth.\nBut the point was, we were talking then about whether or not we could keep the pressure of the international community on Iraq to stay in the box we had them in. And remember, you had the French and others say the reason all those children were dying in Iraq, the reason why hospitals didn't have equipment is because of what we, the United States, were doing, imposing on Iraq these sanctions. And that was the battle. The battle was do we lift these sanctions or do we in fact increase the sanctions? And everyone at the time was talking about–from the secretary of state to even the president–that this was to demonstrate to the world the president of the United States had the full faith and credit of the United States Congress behind him to put pressure on the rest of the world to say, \"Hey, look, you lift the sanctions, you're–we're going to be on our own here. Don't lift the sanctions. Get the inspectors back in.\" That was the context of the debate, to be fair about it.\nRUSSERT: But when you read the national intelligence estimate, which has now been released, there're a lot of caveats put on the level of intelligence about the aluminum tubes and...\nBIDEN: Absolutely.\nRUSSERT: General Zinni, who's been on this program a few weeks ago, said that when he heard the discussion about the weapons of mass destruction that Saddam had, he said, \"I've never heard that\" in any of the briefings he had as head of the Central Command. How could you as a U.S. senator be so wrong?\nBIDEN: I, I wasn't wrong. I was on your show when you asked me about aluminum tubes, and I said they're for artillery. I don't believe they're for cascading.\nRUSSERT: But you said Saddam was a threat. He had to be...\nBIDEN: He was a threat.\nRUSSERT: In what way?\nBIDEN: The threat he presented was that, if Saddam was left unfettered, which I said during that period, for the next five years with sanctions lifted and billions of dollars into his coffers, then I believed he had the ability to acquire a tactical nuclear weapon–not by building it, by purchasing it. I also believed he was a threat in that he was–every single solitary U.N. resolution which he agreed to abide by, which was the equivalent of a peace agreement at the United Nations, after he got out of–after we kicked him out of Kuwait, he was violating. Now, the rules of the road either mean something or they don't. The international community says \"We're going to enforce the sanctions we placed\" or not. And what was the international community doing? The international community was weakening. They were pulling away. They were saying, \"Well, wait a minute. Maybe he's not so bad. Maybe we should lift the no-fly zone. Maybe we should lift the sanctions.\" That was the context.\nAnd on your show, you had that one Sunday the vice president of the United States saying he's reconstituted his nuclear weapons. I was on a simultaneous program, they asked me the question. I said either the president–either the vice president's not telling the truth or he did not get the same briefing I have or he fully misunderstands what he was told. So I did not believe he had weaponized his materials. But he did have material that, in fact, could theoretically be weaponized. And to let it sit there at the time, I wanted the inspectors back in to force him that position of having to give it up.\nRUSSERT: You were asked on this program a few months after the invasion of May of '03 about your vote. And you said, \"There was sufficient evidence to go into Iraq.\" And then in '04 you said–a year and a half ago–\"I voted to give the president the authority to use force in Iraq. I still believe my vote was just.\" Then you went to Iowa in '07, running for president and said, \"It was a mistake. I regret my vote.\"\nBIDEN: That's unfair. I said that on your program it was a mistake between, and you make it sound like I went to Iowa and all of a sudden I had people out there saying Biden is...\nRUSSERT: Well, there was a change in your thinking from, from being...\nBIDEN: No...\nRUSSERT: ...a just vote to saying it was a mistake.\nBIDEN: Yeah, because I learned more, like everybody else learned, about what, in fact, we were told. Even the stuff we were told, the parts that I believed about what was going on with Saddam. We were told at the time, remember, that all these Iraqi generals were ready to, you know, to step up and take on Saddam, that we had–it was implied that we had this ability to go–to do a lot of things we didn't do. We had commitments at the time from the president that he would not move without the international community with us. There were a whole lot of things that changed, a whole lot of things that changed.\nThe thing that I regret, and I'll say it again, and I said it way before '07 and going to Iowa, is that I regret having had the–believed that this administration had any competence. It is the most incompetent administration I've ever–if I'd known they were going to misuse the authority we gave them the way they did, if I'd known that they were going to, once they used it, be so incompetent in the using of it, I would have never ever, ever given them the authority. If I were president, would I have asked for the authority? I would have asked for the authority in order to demonstrate to the world that they better not be lifting sanctions, they better not be putting pressure on having no-fly zones, and they better join with us in putting the screws onto Saddam by screwing down the sanctions on Saddam as opposed to lifting the sanctions. That's what the debate was about at the time.\nAnd the other thing people forget, Tim, is everybody said, \"Well, how could you not know that?\" Almost every major editorial board in the country reached the same conclusion that we reached about the value of keeping the sanctions on Saddam and the need to show the world this pressure was available. And why did they think it? They thought it because he had acted relatively reasonable with regard to Afghanistan. The president had acted rationally with regard to Afghanistan, and on your show–I remember being on your show at the end of that year–and the question was, \"Has the president become an internationalist?\" Remember that? Remember that whole–those, those discussions? So the idea that everybody should have known that they were going to be as irresponsible in the use of the authority, that they were going to overrule what, what Powell was getting done at the United Nations, that they had inspectors back in and then they were going to dis the inspectors like the vice president and president did, maybe I should have anticipated that. But most people didn't anticipate it, and I'm–and that's my mistake.\nRUSSERT: Should you have gone or sought out people who had a dissenting view on the level of weapons of mass destruction?\nBIDEN: Oh, I did. I did. And when I was chairman of the committee–I, I can't tell you the details–but I called every intelligence agency before the Foreign Relations Committee, had them all sit there at once. And it was on the aluminium tubes. And I pointed out to all my colleagues who came that there was vast disagreement among the intelligence community. I also said, you remember after this period, that I believed that the one part of George Tenet that I've heard about his book that I believe is right is that the–it wasn't the administration got all bad intelligence; they misused, deliberately misused the intelligence they had. They only told you the down side. They did not tell you the doubt that existed within the intelligence community. I met with General Zinni, I met with all our major commanders at the time, and they were split about whether or not what he had. But by and large, I don't think any of them really believed that somehow he had a nuclear weapon in the waiting. Nobody believed that.\nRUSSERT: But despite the doubts you heard, you voted for the war.\nBIDEN: I–despite the doubts I heard, I voted to give the president the authority to avoid a war. Look, Tim, he also had–there was no question in the mind–remember we were, we were on this show, Dick Lugar and I. We had the Biden/Lugar authorization through–of the president, which was much more constrained–much more constrained than the authority he actually got. But–and what, what happened? What happened was, I didn't know Dick Gephardt and Joe Lieberman were separately negotiating with the president until I got a call on a Monday night from Dick Lugar saying, \"Look, we're going to lose our, our, our amendment, which is much more constrictive on the president because there's been a separate deal being cut.\" He had 55 votes no matter what.\nRUSSERT: But make no mistake about it, the bill that you voted for authorized the president to go to war.\nBIDEN: It allowed the president to go to war. It did not authorize him to go to it. You make it sound like it said, \"Mr. President, go to war.\" It said, \"Mr. President, don't go to war.\" It said \"go to the United Nations. Mr. President, don't go to war, try to get a deal here. Mr. President, get the inspectors back in. Mr. President, tell us that that's what you're about to do. And, Mr. President, if all else fails, you have authority to use force.\" That's what it said.\nRUSSERT: Do you believe we're safer now that Saddam is gone?\nBIDEN: I believe we are less safe as a nation now because what has happened is the conduct of this war has so badly damaged our readiness; the conduct of this war, and the, and, and, and the blood and resources we've had to expend, it has limited our credibility around the world and limited our flexibility in terms of the use of force. Here we are, we could end the carnage in Darfur tomorrow, but why aren't we doing it? In part we're not doing it because we are so tied down. We could fundamentally change the dynamic in Afghanistan. Why aren't we doing it? Because we are tied down. So in a broad, broad sense–so when I come back on my 41st, if you invite me back, or my 48th trip here, you don't say, \"Well Biden, you know, you, you really like Saddam,\" you know, that's not what this is about. What it's about is Saddam was a butcher, the world's happy, may he burn in hell. He deserves it. But in terms of our globally–global positioning, our geopolitical strategy, as the think-tank guys down here talk about it, we are worse off than we were when we had Saddam sitting there because of the impact on our military and the impact on our credibility.\nRUSSERT: The leader of the Democrats, Harry Reid, two weeks ago offered some comments. Let me share them with you and our viewers and come back and talk about them.\n(Videotape, April 19, 2007)\nSEN. MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID (D-NV): I believe, myself, that the secretary of state, secretary of defense–and you have to make your own decision as to what the president knows–that this war is lost.\n(End videotape)\nRUSSERT: Do you believe the secretary of state, secretary of defense believe the war is lost?\nBIDEN: I believe the secretary of state and secretary of defense believe they don't know what to do with it, and they plan on handing this war over to the next president. I said that a year ago.\nRUSSERT: Do you believe the war is lost?\nBIDEN: I–this is, this is not a game show, where you know, a,a, a football game. What this is about is we have lost 3300 dead, we have 24,000 wounded, and, and we still have an opportunity to deal with the possibility of not trading a dictator for chaos, and–but it will not happen unless we have a serious change in our operating strategic premise. And that is we have to decentralize, not centralize this government. We've got to get the world community in on owning part of this, by calling an international conference to put pressure on the regional powers. If we don't do those two things, I don't see a happy ending to this whole undertaking. We may be forced into a position where there's no option, at some point, to withdraw and try to contain the chaos. The fact of the matter is that there is–I am worried about–my son gets angry with this. My son's unit may get sent to Iraq, and if it does, he goes. I don't want that to happen. But if it happens, it happens. But I don't want my grandson going. And how we leave Iraq is going to determine not merely whether my son goes or not, but whether my grandson goes. So the idea of winning and losing this is the wrong language, in my view. It's about salvaging our interest, or not salvaging our interest. And we're very close to not being able to salvage any of these policies.\nRUSSERT: But these are serious words. If Senator Reid says the war is lost, that's an important choice of words, it's an important message.\nBIDEN: And it's an important message I'm not delivering.\nRUSSERT: So you disagree with him?\nBIDEN: I–he can say what he says, I'll–I stick by what I said.\nRUSSERT: But you say–if you–if you come to the conclusion that the war is lost, then you have an obligation to try to end it and stop funding.\nBIDEN: Well, I think you have an obligation to figure out how to salvage your interests. Look, sometimes the game is lost, but what do you do? You may decide you're going to make sure that your halfback ends up winning the scoring championship by letting him run 12 more times. Look, this is not absolute. There's nothing absolute. If you believe–what is lost, is lost the opportunity to establish a democracy there? Well, that was lost on the day we got there. But if it is about whether or not you can establish a stable regime, an environment so this war doesn't metastasize, you do not have Turkey in after the Kurds, you don't have the Iranians in full-bore, you don't find this thing blowing up around the region, that is not lost yet. But it could be lost. What is the prize? What are we attempting to do here? What I'm attempting to do is protect American interests, so that we do not end up a year, three, five and 10 from now where there is total chaos in the Middle East well beyond the borders of Iraq.\nRUSSERT: The Iraq Study Group said that your idea of partitioning Iraq is, is wrong, and...\nBIDEN: Well...\nRUSSERT: ...and, and would, and would result in even wider civil war. James Baker, the chairman of that committee, said that he's talked to experts and they believe it would trigger a, quote, a \"huge civil war.\" Major cities are mixed between the Shiites and the Sunnis and that basically your plan just wouldn't work.\nBIDEN: Basically, Baker's in a minority. Henry Kissinger's signed onto that plan. Madeleine Albright has signed onto the plan. If you look at the Baker report, it goes on to say \"We may get where Biden is talking about.\" Guess what? We're getting there. What is this administration implicitly acknowledging by building a wall? Give me a break. They're building a wall, and they're talking about a centralized government? Now, look, Tim, you know what happened in the Balkans. Once there was an agreement reached as to this–political agreement reached as to the separation of the parties, from Brcko to Sarajevo to Srebrenica, there was an incredible diminution in the internecine warfare. Why? Because we're in the context of an overall political settlement. What this is all about is maneuvering each of these groups to determine who is going to call the shots. Once you've laid that out and you put yourself in a position where–look, there's never been a time in history that I can think of, Tim, where there's been a self-sustaining cycle of sectarian violence that has ended even remotely reasonably without a federated system. Never. What makes Jim Baker and everyone else think that this is going to be the first time in history that it's different? And mark my words, everybody's coming in the direction that I'm talking about. There's an inevitability to it.\nRUSSERT: Before we take a break, Rudy Giuliani, one of the Republicans running for president, offered this analysis of the Democrats.\nHe said if a Democrat's \"elected president in 2008, America will be at risk for another terrorist attack on the scale of September 11th. ...\n\"If a Republican's elected,\" he said, \"especially if\" it's \"him, terrorist attacks can be anticipated and stopped.\" ...\n\"'But the question is how long will it take,'\" \"'how many casualties will we have?' Giuliani said. 'If we're on defense [with a Democratic president], we'll have more losses,'\" \"'it will go on longer.\n\"'I listen a little to the Democrats and if one of them gets elected, we are going on defense. The Democrats do not understand the full nature and scope of the terrorist war against us.'\"\nBIDEN: While Rudy and his friends were cheering on Star Wars, I made a speech the day before 9/11 to the National Press Club saying that because of the preoccupation of this administration of not focusing on terror, we are going to have a major terrorist attack and it's likely to come in the belly of a plane or in the hull of a ship. Rudy Giuliani continues to abide by and adhere to this utterly failed policy. The message Rudy should be sending is to the president, \"Mr. President, you have not imported any, not a single solitary major recommendation, Mr. President, of the 9/11 Commission. Mr. President the majority of American cities still don't have any interoperable capability. Mr. President, all those cargo containers that come ashore in my city, they're not being inspected, Mr. President.\"\nI say to Rudy, Rudy, you're directing your, your ire at the wrong guy, the guy you continue to cling to. This administration has been almost criminally negligent on what it has done to deal with protecting the homeland. They've cut thousands of cops across the nation. They're the ones who're going to find terrorists walking into an apartment complex that's been empty. They have not done virtually anything the 9/11 Commission has recommended. Rudy is being Rudy, and Rudy is dead wrong, and I really look forward to debating Rudy on this subject.\nRUSSERT: We're going to take a quick break. More of our conversation with Joe Biden, Democratic candidate for president in 2008. Our Meet the Candidate series continues right after this.\n(Announcements)\nRUSSERT: Meet the Candidates 2008, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden right after this station break.\n(Announcements)\nRUSSERT: And we're back, talking to Senator Joe Biden.\nI was up on your Web site looking at some of your campaign positions and promises.\nBIDEN: I, I should go on that site.\nRUSSERT: Yeah. Here's what you say about energy: \"Biden would make a substantial national commitment by dramatically increasing investment in energy and climate change research\" \"technology.\n\"Health care\" \"expand health insurance for children\" \"relieve\" the \"families and\" business \"of the burden of expensive catastrophic cases.\n\"Education\" \"expand help for families by increasing\" \"tax\" deductions \"for tuition payments.\" \"Expand Pell grants to cover the average tuition\" to \"public colleges for low income families.\" \"Expand national service programs\" to help \"high school students so\" \"they can earn money for college.\n\"Homeland Security\" \"take back one year of the tax cuts for Americans who make over a million dollars\" \"and put this money in a dedicated Homeland Security and Public Safety Trust Fund.\n\"Crime: Biden's priority is restoring the nearly $2 billion\" that's \"been cut from state and local law enforcement.\"\nAll noble goals for Democrats, but it's more money, more money, more money.\nBIDEN: Yeah, but it's...\nRUSSERT: Where you going to get it?\nBIDEN: I'll tell you where you get it. First of all, we're going to end this war. It's 100--$100 billion a year we're spending. Number one, it's 100 billion. Eliminate the tax cuts for people making over a million bucks, and they'll go for it. They, they didn't ask for it; they know they don't need it. That's 85 billion bucks a year.\nRUSSERT: But that goes to the trust fund. You still have...\nBIDEN: No, you have–you have...\nRUSSERT: ...energy, health care, education.\nBIDEN: No, I got it. I got it. Let's go through them, because I think you're asking, obviously, a fair question.\nEliminate the, the, the tax break for investment on dividends and–which is $195 billion is, is, is the cost of that. And begin to do, for example, on the crime side, it's pointed out in my crime bill for every single dollar we spent we saved the public $6, $6 dollars. We have to have–there's a fancy word down here–a little new paradigm down here in Washington, as my Republican friends like to say. Investment in these areas saves money. For example, for $26 billion a year, I can insure every single solitary child under the age of 18 in the United States. America doesn't have health insurance. For $3 billion a year, I can double the investment we have on alternative energy sources and research. For a billion dollars a year I can put 50,000 more cops back on the street. And so this is where–we're, we're talking manageable numbers. But the larger point here, in my view, the larger point here, and I think distinguishes me from Democrats, I think we got to start looking at the direct savings that come from the investments we make. If we make an investment in wellness, we save hundreds of billions of dollars here. And so we got to look at it differently, Tim. But you need start-up dollars. The place I'd start off with is somewhere over $220 billion a year by the tax cuts and ending the war. And, by the way, all you need is $10 billion a year for the next five years to fund every single solitary aspect of the 9/11 Commission report, and I would only use 10 of the 85 billion from the top 1 percent for that purpose.\nRUSSERT: But, senator, we have a deficit. We have Social Security and Medicare looming. The number of people on Social Security and Medicare is now 40 million people. It's going to be 80 million in 15 years. Would you consider looking at those programs, age of eligibility...\nBIDEN: Absolutely.\nRUSSERT: ...cost of living, put it all on the table.\nBIDEN: The answer is absolutely. You have to. You know, it's–one of the things that my, you know, the political advisers say to me is, \"Whoa, don't touch that third\"–look, the American people aren't stupid. It's a real simple proposition. We have to do–you and I were talking about Bob Dole earlier. I was one of five people–I was the junior guy in the meeting with Bob Dole and George Mitchell when we put Social Security on the right path for 60 years. I'll never forget what Bob Dole said. After we reached an agreement about gradually raising the retirement age, etc., he said, \"Look, here's the deal, we all put our foot in the boat one at a time.\" And he kicked–he stepped like he was stepping into a boat. \"And we all make the following deal. If any one of the challengers running against the incumbent Democrat or Republicans attack us on this point, we'll all stay together.\" That's the kind of leadership that is needed. Social Security's not the hard one to solve. Medicare, that is the gorilla in the room, and you've got to put all of it on the table.\nRUSSERT: Everything.\nBIDEN: Everything. You've got to.\nRUSSERT: Let me talk–turn to abortion. The ban on partial-birth abortions or late-term abortions, you supported that ban.\nBIDEN: I did and I do.\nRUSSERT: And the Supreme Court came and basically upheld that ban...\nBIDEN: That's right.\nRUSSERT: ...and you criticized the Supreme Court.\nBIDEN: I'll tell you why I criticized the Supreme Court. They upheld the ban, and then they engaged in what we lawyers call dicta that is frightening. You had an intellectually dishonest rationale for an honest justification for upholding the ban, and that was this: They went further, and then they, in the language associated with the decision said, by the way, they blurred whether there is the first trimester and third trimester in how much–I know this is going to sound arcane to the listeners–but whether or not they blurred the distinction between the government's role in being involved in the first day and the ninth month. They blurred the role in terms of whether or not there is–they became paternalistic, talking about the court could consider the impact on the mother and keeping her from making a mistake. This is all code for saying, \"Here we come to undo Roe v. Wade.\" And it went on to say, by the way, that the life of the mother was, in fact, permissible exception, and it went on to say that even–that any woman could challenge, even if her health is at risk, could come back to the court to challenge that. So the bottom line here is, what they did is not so much the decision, the actual outcome of the decision, it's what attended the decision that portends for a real hard move on the court to undo the right of privacy. That's what I'm criticizing about the court's decision.\nRUSSERT: You have changed your position on abortion. When you came to the Senate, you believed that Roe v. Wade was not correctly decided and that you also believed a the right of abortion was not secured by the Constitution. Why did you change your mind?\nBIDEN: Well, I was 29 years old when I came to the United States Senate, and I have learned a lot. Look, Tim, I'm a practicing Catholic, and it is the biggest dilemma for me in terms of comporting my, my religious and cultural views with my political responsibility. And the decision that I have come to is Roe v. Wade is as close to we're going to be able to get as a society that incorporates the general lines of debate within Christendom, Judaism and other faiths, where it basically says there is a sliding scale relating to viability of a fetus. We can argue about whether or not it's precisely set, whether it's right or wrong in terms of its three months as opposed to two months, but it does encompass, I've come to conclude, the only means by which, in this heterogeneous society of ours, we can read some general accommodation on what is a religiously charged and a publicly-charged debate. That's the, that's the decision I've come to.\nEven within our own church, there's been debates about life, you know, from, from \"Summa Theologica,\" Aquinas, and 40 days to quickening and right to, you know, you know, Pious IX, animated fetus doctrine and so on. So this–the, the, the decision's the closest thing politically to what has been the philosophic divisions existent among the major confessional faiths in our country. And that's why, I think, that's why I've come to the conclusion some long time ago, over 25 years ago, that is the–it is the template which makes the most sense.\nRUSSERT: Are you still opposed to public funding for abortion?\nBIDEN: I still am opposed to public funding for abortion, and the reason I am is, again, it goes to the question of whether or not you're going to impose a view to support something that is not a guaranteed right but an affirmative action to promote.\nRUSSERT: Were you yourself–do you believe that life begins at conception?\nBIDEN: I am prepared to accept my church's view. I think it's a tough one. I have to accept that on faith. That is a tough, tough decision to me. But there is a point relatively soon where viability–it's clear to me when there's viability, meaning the ability to survive outside the womb, that I don't have any doubt. That's why the late-term abortion, and that's why I continue, like your old boss Pat Moynihan, shared the same view, he was very pro-choice is–to use the jargon. But he, like me, believed that you have this notion of abortion in the last month, where there's clearly viability. And if you make that judgment based upon the nature of the child's health, that is not a good basis for a societal decision. Only the mother's health should be–dictate the outcome then. Otherwise, you, you yield to the side of the–of, of, of the fetus, which is almost full term.\nRUSSERT: Let me bring you back to November of '03. You were asked this question. \"Do you believe gay marriage is inevitable?\" Biden: \"I'm not sure. I think probably it is.\"\nBIDEN: Well, I think it probably is because social mores change. But look, Tim, I don't think the government can dictate the definition of marriage to religious institutions. But government does have an obligation to guarantee that everybody has, every individual is free of discrimination. And there's a distinction. You and I talk–I shouldn't say this–I think we did–talked about Meacham's book, the \"American Gospel.\" And I, anticipating you asking me this, I wrote a quote from his, from his book that I think sums it up. He says, \"The American gospel is that religion shapes the life of the nation without strangling it.\" That's where I think–that's how we have to view these very difficult decisions. I think government should not be able to dictate to religions the definition of marriage, but I think, on a civil side, government has the obligation to strip away every vestige of discrimination as to what individuals are able to do in terms of their personal conduct.\nRUSSERT: So New Hampshire coming out in favor of civil unions is OK by you?\nBIDEN: Yes. Yes, it is.\nRUSSERT: Let me turn to the debate on Thursday night, and Brian Williams' question of you and your answer. Here it is.\n(Videotape, Thursday)\nBRIAN WILLIAMS: (From MSNBC Democratic Candidates Debate) Senator Biden, words have, in the past, gotten you in trouble, words that were borrowed and words that some found hateful. An editorial in the Los Angeles Times said, \"In addition to his uncontrolled verbosity, Biden is a gaffe machine.\" Can you reassure the voters in this country that you would have the discipline you would need on the world stage, senator?\nBIDEN: Yes.\n(End videotape)\nRUSSERT: Was that hard?\nBIDEN: No, not at all.\nRUSSERT: You have gotten in trouble with your language. When you said that Barack Obama was clean and articulate, you apologized for it. Richard Cohen of The Washington Post wrote this: \"Loose Lips Sink. The only thing standing between Joe Biden and the presidency is his mouth. His Achilles' heel is his mouth.\" Do you have a problem?\nBIDEN: No. I don't have a–look, I have met with more world leaders and as many world leaders as anybody who sits in government today. They've never had a problem understanding me. Milosevic had no problem understanding me when I said, \"I think you're a war criminal. I'm going to do everything in power to see you're tried as one.\" The prime minister of, of Great Britain's never misunderstood me. All the way back to Deng Xiaoping, he never understood–misunderstood me. Look, this is a rough game, man. This is a very rough game. My referring to Barack as articulate, it was a mistake. But guess what, if you look at–I will not mention the national press person who just–in saying that the problem with Barack's appearance last–on the debate was he wasn't articulate enough. I mean look, give me–give me a break. The average American out there understands–look, let me put it another way. The good thing about being around a long time is people have a basis upon which to judge you. And I didn't find any serious person in the civil rights community, because of my long history and long support for civil rights, thinking that I was trying to insult Barack Obama in any way. I didn't find anyone suggesting that anything else I have said goes to the heart of whether or not my record is, is being undercut by what I've stated. But it is true. It is true that my candor sometimes get me in trouble.\nRUSSERT: And so does, sometimes, your embellishment. You go back to '88 when you withdrew as a candidate, this is the way E.J., E.J. Dionne wrote it: \"Mr. Biden's trouble began with the revelation that he had used, without attribution, long portions of a moving address by the British Labor Party leader, Neil Kinnock.\" \"It emerged\" \"he had also used passages from the speeches of Robert\" \"Kennedy\" \"Hubert Humphrey.\" \"It was revealed that Mr. Biden had been disciplined as a first-year law student for using portions of a law review article in a paper without proper attribution\" and \"was hit again by a videotape of\" his \"appearance in New Hampshire in which he misstated several facts about his academic career.\" That was a problem.\nBIDEN: No, it was.\nRUSSERT: And you learned from it?\nBIDEN: I did. It was 20 years ago, and I learned from it. The good for me is, and the bad news, people have had 20 years to judge since then whether or not I am the man they see or I am what I was characterized as being 20 years ago. I learned a lot from it, and, let me tell you, it was a bitter way to learn it, but I learned a lot.\nRUSSERT: Let me ask you about something you said at Al Sharpton's National Action Network on April 19th. Here it is, and let's come back and talk about it.\n(Videotape, April 19, 2007)\nSEN. BIDEN: To paraphrase a line from the Bible, you reap what you sow. And ladies and gentlemen, we are reaping what we have sown, the seeds of destruction and the seeds of malcontention that we've sown. I would argue, since 1994 with the Gingrich revolution, ladies and gentlemen, just take a look at Iraq, Venezuela, Katrina, what's gone down in Virginia Tech, Darfur, Imus. Take a look. This didn't happen accidentally, all of these things. Since 1994, from the Gingrich revolution to Karl Rove and President Bush, we have wallowed, wallowed in the politics of polarization.\n(End videotape)\nRUSSERT: Explain that logic. How does Virginia Tech or Don Imus, relate to the Gingrich revolution or Karl Rove or George Bush?\nBIDEN: Well, by the way, they're, they're, they're not directly responsible for any of those things, but the atmosphere–look, think of it this way, how many shock jocks did we have in 1970s and the 1980s? What happened when we concluded that when Newt Gingrich said the way to win the House is to burn the House down? When all of the sudden we went from–I served, for example, I got here and a lot of old segregationists were still here. Yet, we did not engage in arguments about motive, we engaged in arguments about policy. And all of a sudden, in the, in the mid '90s, it became \"If you're not with us, you're not a good Christian. If you're not with us, you're not moral. If you share a view, you are unpatriotic.\" The whole nature of the debate changed. You had senators talking about the president of the United States on the floor calling him Bubba. And we wonder why that doesn't percolate through the entire society.\nRUSSERT: But Virginia Tech? How does that relate?\nBIDEN: Oh, well, what Virginia Tech is about is the debate that come out–came out afterwards, where you had this whole debate about, you know, if everybody had a gun, this wouldn't have happened and so on. I mean, it wasn't–it didn't produce that kid, that kid was mentally deranged. And it didn't produce that.\nBut think of the–all the other things, Tim. I mean, you cannot engage–a leader cannot engage–the leaders of the country cannot engage in this kind of, of, of talk and the way we characterize people and the hatefulness of it and think it doesn't permeate society. As I said earlier, you know, the famous line of Pat Moynihan, we've defined decency down. I mean, look, what we've defined down is, is civility in this country. I mean, things that you could say today in the public square, you would have been pilloried for saying in 1975. It matters.\nRUSSERT: You said this back in September of 1987 as sort of a diagnosis about yourself, \"I exaggerate when I'm angry.\"\nBIDEN: Yeah. That's true. I did. And look, and that, and that was '87. And, and, and the question was related directly to a guy asking me about where I stood in my class. And I was like–I was an immature 42-year-old guy who was acting like \"Your mother wears combat boots\" in response. I thought he was challenging my–and I just went out at it, and I didn't know where the heck I ended up in my class. I honest to God had no–I wonder how many Americans would say, \"Tell me exactly where you ended up in your class,\" and they could give you a number. And I just went out, and I was angry. But that had–I mean, I have, a lot's happened in my life since then. And hopefully I'm a much–I've controlled that, that, that anger. I mean, the joke was I had two craniotomies, and, you know, because I had two major aneurysms, and they had to take the top of my head off a couple times. And as one wag in Delaware said, writing about it, the reason they had to go in a second time is they couldn't find a brain the first time. Well, I hope when they were in the second time, they cut the temper cord...\nRUSSERT: So the exaggeration and the anger is gone?\nBIDEN: Yeah, it is gone, because all you've got to do is lie in a hospital bed for five months, them telling you you're not going to make it and–to give you a new appreciation for the lack of urgency in anything other than life-and-death issues.\nRUSSERT: Joe Biden said that he needed to raise $40 million to be viable in this campaign. Thus far you've raised about $2 million. You're 2 percent in the polls. Are you viable?\nBIDEN: Yes. I think what I said was that I needed to be able to get through the campaign. That's what I had to do, not to start the campaign. I believe to get through the first–and I have to admit to you, I admit I thought a lot more about how to be president than how to get elected president, but I think I can raise sufficient money to make me viable in the first four contests, and I think that's going to be where the decision is made about who the next nominee's going to be.\nRUSSERT: You said in the debate whoever wishes for Hillary is making a big mistake on the Republican side. You seem to be almost a quasi-endorsement. Are you interested in being vice president?\nBIDEN: No. I will not be vice president under any circumstances.\nRUSSERT: How about secretary of state?\nBIDEN: Secretary of state's a different thing, but I don't–I won't do that either. Look, the bottom line is, I really resent it when they go after her or other Democrats the way they do. I think it's–I think part of this is being fair. And the idea that Hillary Clinton is somehow not capable of dealing with–or any one of those candidates, or at least four of the candidates–not being able to deal with Rudy Giuliani I find–or others–I, I find not very accurate.\nRUSSERT: Senator Joe Biden, we thank you for joining us...\nBIDEN: Thanks a lot.\n",

Joe Biden received rave reviews following his emergence in last week's first Democratic debate held at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg. Immediately following the debate, and continuing throughout the weekend as the candidates attended the South Carolina State Democratic Party Convention activities, the compliments piled up. Below please find a sampling of the reviews and coverage from the campaign trip.\n\"If I had to pick a winner tonight just because of that reason, I would pick Senator Biden...Senator Biden may be on the fringe of the leading candidates now but because he has a plan, a controversial plan in Iraq, and because he is so strong spoken about it, he could have a bigger role as the campaign plays out...\"\n-John King, Larry King Live, CNN, 4/26/07\n\"Biden did a brilliant job of playing against type and that's the kind of thing that makes you stand out in these debates when you do something a little unexpected. It didn't exactly catapult him into the first tier of candidates, but I think Joe Biden did himself a little bit of good last night.\"\n- Jonathan Alter, Newsweek Senior Editor and Columnist, on 4/29/07\n\"I thought Biden did a god job. I think Biden jumped out in terms of national security.\"\n- Juan Williams, NPR, on FoxNews Sunday 4/29/07\n\"Joe Biden did exceptionally well. He has been doing well with independent voters.\"\n- Congressman James Clyburn, \"Clyburn sings Clinton's praises in post-debate review,\" McClatchy Newspapers, 4/27/07\n\"[Biden] highlighted foreign policy experience as expected but also demonstrated grasp of a wide range of issues. [Biden's] performance could help him move out of second tier.\"\n- The State, \"How Candidates Fared in Debate,\" 4/27/07\n\"I think the American people are counting on our elected officials to be adults. I happen to believe that Joe Biden probably has the best plan on this. Look at some kind of partition plan of three states there in Iraq. We have to recognize we cannot mediate and referee a civil war.\"\n- Harold Ford, Jr., Fox News, 4/26/07\nOn who was successful in the debate: \"I think Biden did, in some ways, the best.\"\n- Fareed Zakaria, Newsweek, This Week, 4/29/07\n\"I agree.\"\n-George Stephanopoulos, This Week, 4/29/07\n\"S.C. native John Edwards got the hometown hero's treatment at the state Democratic Party convention Saturday, although it was challenger Joe Biden who brought the crowd to its feet.\"\n- The State, \"Democrats applaud anti-war speeches,\" 4/29/07\n",

He took us to war unnecessarily without letting the weapons inspectors finish their work. He took us to war without a plan to stabilize Iraq. He took us to war without enough troops, without the right equipment for the troops we sent, or the proper care for those who came home wounded.\n\"Now, by continuing this war indefinitely, he is sending soldiers back on third and fourth tours; extending the time they spend in Iraq; abolishing the practice of keeping them home for a year between tours; and diverting the National Guard and Reserve from critical missions here at home.\n\"Nothing is more outrageous than the President's claim that those who criticize his conduct of the war are undermining our troops or emboldening the enemy.

    "text": "\nFour Years After \"Mission Accomplished,\" Iraq Still Most Important Issue\nWilmington, DE - Today, on the fourth anniversary of President Bushs famous \"Mission Accomplished\" Speech, Sen. Joe Biden called for a national debate on Iraq.\n\"From his declaration four years ago that combat operations were over, to his 'Bring it On ' statement, to his repeated claims that we're making progress in Iraq, this President has lost all credibility with the American people,\" said Biden. \"It's time to stop waging this war with sound bites and have a real debate about our options.\"\nSen. Biden called on the national news networks to sponsor a full 90-minute televised debate exclusively on Iraq giving all the Presidential candidates an opportunity to present their views on the most pressing questions regarding the war and give specifics on their plans.\nBacking this call, Biden has launched an online petition, entitled \"60 Seconds is Not Enough,\" urging supporters to call for a nationally televised debate on Iraq. Supporters can sign the petition at www.JoeBiden.com.\n\"The one thing everyone agrees on is the need for a political solution in Iraq. One year ago today, Les Gelb and I presented a plan to quell the violence in Iraq and bring our troops home without leaving chaos behind,\" said Biden. \"It's time we all stood before the American people and presented our ideas. This is the most pressing issue of our time -- everything else pales in comparison. It's ridiculous to try to shoe-horn it into 60 seconds.\"\nToday, May 1st 2007, marks the one year anniversary of the day Senator Biden unveiled a plan, along with Council on Foreign Relations President Emeritus Les Gelb, that focuses on a political solution to quell the violence in Iraq. The Biden-Gelb plan provides for a central government that would be responsible for border defense, foreign policy, oil production and revenues. The Biden-Gelb plan would make the regional governments in Iraq Kurd, Sunni and Shiite responsible for administering their own regions, giving each group breathing space and reducing the likelihood of continued sectarian conflict.

    "text": "\nBiden-Gelb Plan for a Decentralized Iraq is Best Chance to Leave Iraq Without Leaving Chaos Behind\nWashington, DC - One year ago today, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) and President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations Leslie H. Gelb announced a five-point plan for a way forward in Iraq. The Biden-Gelb plan called for decentralizing Iraq separating the parties and giving them breathing room in their own regions, held together by a limited central government.\n\"One year ago today, Les Gelb and I announced our plan for a way forward in Iraq. And one year later with the Administration's flawed policy leading us nowhere and today's news that April is the deadliest month this year our plan becomes more urgent every day.\"\n\"The Bush administration still believes that Iraqis will rally to a strong, democratic central government that treats everyone equitably. And the surge is designed to buy time for that government to get its act together. But there is no trust within the government, no trust of the government by the people and no capacity by the government to deliver security and services. And there is no prospect that we can build that trust and capacity any time soon. So the basic premise of the administration's approach is fundamentally and fatally flawed,\" Biden said.\n\"History suggests only there's only a couple other ways to keep together a country consumed by sectarian strife. One, you occupy the country for a generation or more. That's not in our DNA we're not the Persian Empire or the British Empire. Two, you install a dictator. Wouldn't that be the ultimate irony for the United States to go back after taking one down and install another one? Three, you let them fight it out until one side massacres the other and that's not an option in that tinderbox part of the world. Or lastly, you make federalism work for the Iraqis. You give them control over the fabric of their daily lives. You separate the parties. You give them breathing room. Let them control their local police, their education, their religion and marriage the very things they're fighting over. That's the only possibility: change the focus to a limited central government and the federal system that their constitution calls for,\" said Sen. Biden.\n\"Leaving Iraq is necessary,\" Biden said, \"but it is not enough because it doesn't answer the critical question: 'then, what?' We also need a plan for what we leave behind, so that we don't trade a dictator for chaos that undermines American interests for decades. This plan offers the possibility of bringing stability to Iraq.\"\nSpecifically, the Biden-Gelb Five-Point Plan for Iraq would:\n\nMaintain a unified Iraq by decentralizing it and giving Kurds, Shiites and Sunnis breathing room in their own regions and control over the fabric of their daily lives, including the police, education, jobs, marriage and religion. The Iraqi constitution already provides for federalism. The central government would be responsible for common interests, like border security and the distribution of oil revenues.\n\n\nSecure support from the Sunnis - who have no oil -- by guaranteeing them a proportionate share (about 20 percent) of oil revenues, allowing former Baathists to go back to work and re-integrating those with no blood on their hands.\n\n\nIncrease economic aid, direct it to the regions as well as the central government, ask oil-rich Arab Gulf states to fund it, tie assistance to the protection of minority rights and create a jobs program to deny the militia new recruits.\n\n\nConvene a regional conference to enlist the support of Iraq's neighbors and create a Contact Group of the major powers to enforce their commitments.\n\n\nAsk our military for a plan to responsibly withdraw most U.S. forces from Iraq by 2008 - enough time for the political settlement to take hold while refocusing the mission of a small residual force on counter-terrorism and training Iraqis.\n\nSince Sen. Biden and Les Gelb announced their five-point plan for a way forward in Iraq on May 1, 2006, the plan has sparked growing interest and support from political leaders, foreign policy experts and opinion leaders.\nTHE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE (NIE) ON THE CENTRAL ELEMENT OF THE BIDEN-GELB PLAN\nThe National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq a consensus report of all U.S. intelligence agencies makes clear the need for a political settlement based on federalism, as called for in the Biden-Gelb plan.\nThe NIE identifies developments that could \"reverse the negative trends driving Iraq's current trajectory,\" including: \"broader Sunni acceptance of the current political structure and federalism\" and \"significant concessions by Shia and Kurds to create space for Sunni acceptance of federalism.\" These elements are central to the Biden-Gelb plan for Iraq.\nThe NIE also warns of the danger of Iraq's civil war becoming a regional war, which underscores the urgent need for a regional diplomatic strategy that involves Iraq's neighbors in supporting a political settlement or containing the violence should reconciliation fail, as called for in the Biden-Gelb plan. [ U.S. National Intelligence Estimate, 2/2/07]\nFORMER SECRETARIES OF STATE ON THE BIDEN-GELB PLAN\nFormer Secretary of State Henry Kissinger: \"I'm sympathetic to an outcome that permits large regional autonomy. In fact, I think it is very likely that this will emerge out of the conflict that we are now witnessing.\"\n\"If the Iraqis cannot solve the problems that have been described, I've told the Chairman privately, that I thought that this [a federal system in Iraq] was a possible outcome, and at the right moment we should work in the direction that will (inaudible) for maximum stability and for maximum chances of peace.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, January 31, 2007]\nFormer Secretary of State Madeleine Albright: \"[T]he idea of the constitution of Iraq [as] written, which allows for and mandates, in fact, a great deal of regional autonomy, is appropriate. I think there are certain central powers that a government needs. Some of it has to do with the oil revenue and various other parts. So without endorsing any plan, I do think reality here sets in that there will be regional autonomy.\"\n[W]hen asked about Senator Biden's plan, I have said that, in fact, it is an attempt to keep the country together, which I do believe is what it is about. I'm just talking about in the long run what might happen that we do have to watch out for. But I think it is very clear from my reading of the plan that it is done in order to keep the country together. And I do think that is an essential point. [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, January 31, 2007]\nFormer Secretary of State James Baker: \"I was and still am interested in the proposal that Senator Biden and Les Gelb put forward with respect to the idea that ultimately you may end up with three autonomous regions in Iraq, because I was worried that there are indications that that might be happening, in fact, on the ground anyway and, if it is, we ought to be prepared to try and manage the situation. So we have a sentence in our report that says, 'If events were to move irreversibly in this direction, the United States should manage the situation to ameliorate the humanitarian consequences, contain the violence and minimize regional stability.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, January 30, 2007]\nFOREIGN POLICY EXPERTS ON THE BIDEN-GELB PLAN\nFormer Iraq Defense Minister Ali Allawi: \"I think the solution has to be to really face the fact that the invasion, occupation of the country has led to really enormous consequences, not only inside the Iraq but in the region. Unless you administer and control the effects of the invasion, you're unlikely to have much peace. And to do that I think you have to take into account that certain irreversible changes have taken place, especially, for example, the empowerment of the Shiite community, the empowerment of the Kurds, and the effects of that on the various countries of the Middle East.\nJON STEWART: So you see sort of a central government, kind of existing to mediate between Kurds, Shi'a, and Sunni, but then they also have autonomy of their own?\nAllawi: I think so. In the long term, if you want to have a nation state, these components have to be brought together again. You have to reweave the structures of the country and society. And a central government that is based on a kind of federal arrangement is possibly the best outcome.\" [The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, 4/18/07]\nAmbassador Dennis Ross, Counselor and Ziegler Distinguished Fellow, The Washington Institute for Near East Policy: \"The only thing I would say, though, as I've noted before, with 100,000 Iraqis being displaced a month, you're beginning to create the outlines of that on the ground [a federal system in Iraq]. So I was actually in favor of the idea before, and I think it may have more of a potential now because of that reality.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, January 17, 2007]\nAmbassador Richard Haass, President Council on Foreign Relations: \"I've long admired the chairman's idea [Of a federal system in Iraq].The problem is -- it's also put forward by my predecessor -- the problem is not the idea. The idea's a reasonable idea; it's a good idea. The problem facing the idea is that it's a reasonable idea that's been introduced into an unreasonable political environment. If Iraqis were willing to sign on to this idea of distribution of political and economic power and so forth, federalism, all Iraqis would be better off and a large part of the problem would fade. The problem is that we can't get Iraqis to sign on to a set of arrangements that, quite honestly, would leave the bulk of them better off. We can't force them to be reasonable. And at the moment, they've essentially embarked on a path which is in some ways self- destructive of a society. So again -- but the flaw is not inherent in the ideas; it's just, again, we can't -- the very reasonableness that's at the heart of the chairman's idea is rejected again by -- virtually across the board, particularly by Shi'a and Sunnis, because they can't agree on the precise balance, if you will, of political and economic power within their society. So at the moment, there's not yet a federal scheme they would sign on to.\" [ Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, January 17, 2007]\nMichael O'Hanlon, Senior Fellow, The Brookings Institution: \"It would be preferableto retain some level of multi-ethnic society... However, let's be clear about what the data show -- it's happening already. And right now, it's the militias and the death squads that are driving the ethnic cleansing, and the movement towards a breakup of Iraq. And the question pretty soon is going to be whether we try to manage that process, or let the militias alone drive it, because it's happening.100,000 people a month are being driven from their homes. Iraq looks like Bosnia more and more.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/10/07]\nYahia Said, Director, Iraq Revenue Watch: \" I think the constitution, the Iraqi constitution, with all its shortcomings, serves as a good starting point for dialogue. But the constitution needs to be transformed through genuine dialogue from a dysfunctional to a rational federal structure. Oil and negotiations on an oil deal, which have apparently concluded recently, also provide a model for the -- for that rational federalism.The main principles that the negotiators have agreed on is to maximize the benefit of Iraq's oil wells to all Iraqis, to use oil as a way to unite the nation, and to build a framework based on transparency, which is very important in a situation of lack -- of poor trust, and on efficiency and equity. \" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/10/07]\nFormer UN Ambassador Richard Holbrooke: \"I urge [President Bush] to lay out realistic goals, redeploy our troops and focus on the search for a political solution. We owe that to the Iraqis who welcomed the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and put their trust in us, only to find their lives in danger as a result. By a political solution, I mean something far more ambitious than current U.S. efforts aimed at improving the position of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki by changing ministers or setting timelines for progress. Sen. Joe Biden and Les Gelb have advocated what they call, in a reference to the negotiations that ended the war in Bosnia in 1995, a \"Dayton-like\" solution to the political situation -- by which they mean a looser federal structure with plenty of autonomy for each of the three main groups, and an agreement on sharing oil revenue.\" [Washington Post (10/24/06)]\nAmbassador Peter W.

Perhaps at some point the various factions in Iraq will agree on compromise, either a reasonably peaceful, formal partition, or a very loose federation with adequate political compromise.

And that takes heavy lifting. Politically, a lot of objections even to bringing it up before their congress, but we have to keep insisting that they do.

It gives the provinces the power to have their own security services, to send ambassadors to foreign countries, to join together to form regions. Decentralization is not an American imposition, it's an Iraqi idea. .In short, logic, circumstances and politics are leading inexorably toward soft partition. The Bush administration has been slow to recognize its virtues because it is too dependent on the Green Zone Iraqis.

That option recognizes that Iraq is broken and that its people are fleeing their homes to survive. It calls for a ''soft partition'' of Iraq in order to bring political institutions into accord with the social facts -- a central government to handle oil revenues and manage the currency, etc., but a country divided into separate sectarian areas to reduce contact and conflict. When the various groups in Bosnia finally separated, it became possible to negotiate a cold (if miserable) peace. Soft partition has been advocated in different ways by Joe Biden and Les Gelb, by Michael O'Hanlon and Edward Joseph, by Pauline Baker at the Fund for Peace, and in a more extreme version, by Peter Galbraith.\" [New York Times, Breaking the Clinch (1/25/07)]\n\"The liberals who favor quick exit never grappled with the consequences of that policy, which the Baker-Hamilton commission terrifyingly described.

Biden also urged Gov. Richardson and Sen. Clinton to support his proposal to limit the mission of the troops serving in Iraq which will allow us to responsibly withdraw all U.S. combat forces not needed for this more limited mission early next year.\nThe Biden Campaign also released a video on YouTube entitled: Follow The Leader which is available at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJvsNmqGUvA.\nOn January 5th, EJ Dionne wrote in the Washington Post, More intriguing, Biden is studying whether Congress might reconsider the original Iraq war resolution, now as out of date as the administration's prewar claims. The resolution includes references to a \"significant chemical and biological weapons capability\" that Iraq didn't have and repeated condemnations of \"the current Iraqi regime,\" i.e., the Saddam Hussein regime that fell long ago. In effect, the resolution authorizes a war on an enemy who no longer exists and for purposes that are no longer relevant. (Washington Post, January 5, 2007)\nOn January 18th, on CNNs The Situation Room, Sen. Biden said, We have the power -- and I'm working on a resolution -- that will say the authorization for use of force that we gave you 3 1/2 years ago is no longer valid. There's a new authorization to use and here are the limitations on your use. There are constitutional ways to do this.\nTHEN\nOn February 3rd, Governor Richardson said, You know, as someone who served in the congress for 14 years, I know the power they hold should they choose to wield it. The congress passed the resolution authorizing war. They need to pass another one that overturns that authorization and brings our troops home by the end of this calendar year. You would think -- you would think that when the congress realized they were lied to, they would have done something about it.\nYesterday, May 3rd, Senator Clinton said, It is time to sunset the authorization for the war in Iraq.

    "text": "\nWashington, DC - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) discussed the national security threats of global warming today at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee and advocated that the U.S. address all aspects of climate change.\n\"We need to change the way we think and talk about global warming,\" said Sen. Biden. \"What is at stake here is more than the environmental health of the planet. Climate change is a new and very different national security challenge. If it continues at the current rate, it will cause shifts in fundamental building blocks of economic, social and political systems around the world.\"\n\"Throughout human history, disruption on this scale almost always meant war. In those nations already on the brink, governments will lack the capacity to cope. When that happens, we will either be drawn in early, to mitigate the worst of the climate effects, or we will be drawn in later, when conflict has destabilized those countries. We need a strong domestic and international response to the threats of climate change that increases our energy security and that slows, stops and reverses the buildup of greenhouse gases. Absent such a policy, our national security is at risk,\" said Sen. Biden.\nThe full text of Sen. Biden's prepared remarks for the Senate Foreign Relations Hearing on Climate Change are included below:\n\"Under the distinguished leadership of Senator Lugar, this Committee focused on the national security threats that flow from our country's dependence on imported oil. We have paid a high price over many decades - and not just financially - to secure the lifeblood of our economy.\n\"The hearings we held, and the cold hard facts they illuminated, have begun to change the debate. We are no longer simply asking what it takes to secure oil from foreign sources.\n\"We are asking new questions: how do we move away from oil, how and how soon can we develop the alternative technologies that can loosen the grip of oil on our economy and our foreign policy?\n\"How, in short, can we achieve real energy security?\n\"This morning, we have the chance to change another, very closely related debate - how we talk, how we think about climate change. We are here to discuss an important new report by the Center for Naval Analyses Corporation, \"National Security and the Threat of Climate Change.\" With us are three members of the Military Advisory Board responsible for this study. The real contribution of this report will be to change the way we think and talk about global warming: as a new and very different national security challenge. It will change the way we calculate the risks we face, the way we calculate the costs and benefits of our energy and climate policies.\n\"I want to welcome our witnesses today, three members of that distinguished Military Advisory Board.\nAdmiral Joseph W. Prueher, USN (Ret.), Former Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Command and Former U.S. Ambassador to China.\nVice Admiral Richard H. Truly, USN (Ret.) Former NASA Administrator, Shuttle Astronaut and the first Commander of Naval Space Command.\nGeneral Charles F. Wald, USAF (Ret.) Former Deputy Commander, Headquarters U.S. European Command.\n\"I'm afraid those brief introductions cannot give due credit to the outstanding service you have all given our nation. The report you have brought us is striking in several ways - the first of which relates to its position on the science. Comprised of retired flag and general officers from all four services, the Advisory Board brought to this task many combined decades of experience analyzing risk. The intelligence they used in their uniformed careers to assess the threats facing this country ranged from atomic physics to, quite literally, rocket science.\n\"They understand the need for the best available technical information. They also understand the need to make decisions in the absence of absolute mathematical certainty.\n\"Here are the words of one member of the Board not with us today, General Gordon Sullivan, former Chief of Staff of the Army: \"We never have 100 percent certainty. We never have it. If you wait until you have 100 percent certainty, something bad is going to happen on the battlefield.\"\n\"This report moves us beyond the paralyzing debate of over 100 percent scientific certainty. The authors have seen that the science is robust and convincing. Their conclusion: a call for action.\n\"Second, I was struck by the clarity of the connections between the predictable effects of global warming and the human actions that we know will follow. The report warns us to first expect profound shifts in the fundamental building blocks of nations and economies. Climate change will reduce access to fresh water, impair food production, spread diseases, erode coasts and increase flooding, displacing millions.\n\"Then, the report shows us the consequences. Throughout human history disruption on this scale almost always and everywhere meant war. In those nations already on the brink, governments will lack the capacity to cope.\n\"When that happens, we will either be drawn in early, to mitigate the worst of the climate effects, or we will be drawn in later, when conflict has destabilized those countries.\n\"This report shows how global warming will become a \"threat multiplier for instability\" and push failing states over the edge. And it shows why delay, indifference, and inaction are no longer options.\n\"Finally, I was struck by the positive, mission-oriented response of this report. Here are some of the report's recommendations. Our national intelligence estimates should account for the threat of climate change. Senator Hagel has been a leader on this matter. I have joined him and Senator Durbin on their legislation calling for the incorporation of climate change in those estimates. Our defense strategies should also address the effects of climate change, as should our Quadrennial Defense Review. We know the threat. Our plans must reflect it. The report calls for stronger national and international efforts by the United States to stabilize climate change - that means cutting the deals that will cut the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming.\n\"Senator Lugar and I, along with two dozen colleagues from both sides of the aisle, hope the Senate will soon be able to take up and pass our Resolution calling for the return to U.S. leadership in global climate negotiations.\n\"The assessment of this report is that our current efforts are not adequate to the threat we face. There is much more to be explored here, so I want to get to the testimony of our distinguished panel and to our discussion.\n\"I will close with this. Climate, energy, national security - these are all facets of the same single challenge: A strong domestic and international response that increases our energy security, that slows, stops and reverses the buildup of greenhouse gases. That policy will make us more secure. Absent such a policy, we will be less secure. Denial, delay, and half measures are not going to be the order of the day anymore, I hope. This report takes all excuses off the table.\n",

    "text": "\nLays Out College Affordability Plan as Part of a 21st Century School System Before American Federation of Teachers Executive Council Meeting\nSilver Spring, MD - In a speech before the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) Executive Council meeting in Maryland about the need to design a 21st century school system that will allow our children to compete in today's global economy, Sen. Joe Biden today outlined the details of his plan to make college affordable by creating the College ACCESS credit, a $3,000 refundable tax credit for families making up to $166,000 a year.\n\"The responsibility lies with America's leaders to establish new policies that will enable the restoration of the middle class. I've been asking a rhetorical question as I campaign across the country 'Does anybody think in the 21st century you can get a ticket to the middle class without a college education?' said Sen. Biden. \"We must afford our children and our grandchildren the opportunities they deserve to receive the best possible education so that ultimately, we remain a force in today's competitive global economy.\"\nBuilding on his long record of supporting substantial tax incentives to help low and middle class families, Biden's College ACCESS credit would cover the average cost of tuition at a public two-year college and would cover approximately half of the average cost of tuition at a public four-year college by:\nConsolidating two existing tax incentives the Hope Scholarship Credit and the tuition and fees deduction and replacing them with a single $3,000 refundable tax credit that is the equivalent of a $12,000 deduction.\nExpanding income limits so that most families are eligible for the tax credit and making it refundable so that families of all income backgrounds get the same benefit.\nSimplifying the existing higher education tax incentives to make it easier for families to understand and navigate the maze of incentives.\nAdditionally, the Biden College ACCESS Plan would increase the maximum Pell Grant to $5,100 immediately, followed by increases of $300 per year for the next five years. And, the Biden plan will begin the conversation with students earlier by committing Pell Grants to students in the 8th grade.\n\"Last year, 400,000 young men and women got into college but were unable to go because their families could not afford it. Unless America changes course, it is estimated that over the next decade 2 million college-ready students are in danger of not attending college because they can't afford it\" said Sen. Biden. \"I know the American people are ready to step up to the ball to deal with college education, and I believe my plan provides the measures by which to make a college education a reality for all students, no matter what their economic means are.\"\n",

Biden, Jr. issued the following statement today after speaking on the Senate Floor about this Administrations failed policy in Iraq and voting in favor of limiting the mission in Iraq:\nWith every passing day that the situation in Iraq does not improve and the President refuses to change course, the pressure builds on Congress to act. Right now, we may not have the votes to force the Presidents hand. But sooner or later, our colleagues will stop voting with the President and start backing what the American people want: a responsible end to this war.\nBut until we have the votes to force the President to change, we have to keep the pressure on him, every single day. Thats what todays vote is about. It requires each of us to make clear where we stand.\nThe Reid-Feingold amendment dramatically limits the mission of our troops in Iraq and will allow us to bring most of them home.\nKeeping our soldiers in the middle of a civil war which is the current path were on makes zero sense. There is no gain there, only loss. We have to limit the mission of our troops to combating Al Qaeda and like-minded terrorist groups and continuing to train Iraqis. If we limit the mission in that way, the President will not be able to justify keeping 160,000 Americans in Iraq especially at a time when our military is dangerously over-stretched.\nThe President continues to dig us into a deeper and deeper hole in Iraq. Right now, the most important thing we can do is keep the pressure on him and our Republican colleagues to change course.\n",

Joe Biden will continue to court labor endorsements this evening as part of the AFL-CIO's 'Presidential Candidate' series. At the town hall meeting style event, Biden will lay out the details of his plan to make college affordable by creating the College ACCESS credit.\nBiden will point to the fact that the failure of President Bush's Iraq policy stymies our domestic policy goals, including being able to make a college education more affordable and accessible. He will outline the progress on healthcare, energy, homeland security and education we could make if we weren't spending $100 billion a year on the war in Iraq.\n\"In order for us to regain the flexibility to be able to do the things we have to do to affect union brothers and sisters all across the country, and working men and women as well, in order to gain the credibility to deal with the problems we have at home, we have to do one important thing first: We've got to end this war,\" said Biden.\nYesterday, Sen. Biden introduced his College Affordability and Creating Chances for Educational Success for Students (ACCESS) Plan, designed to make college more affordable by creating the ACCESS credit, a $3,000 refundable tax credit for families making up to $166,000 a year The ACCESS credit would cover the average cost of tuition and fees at a two-year public college ($2300) and cover more than half of the average cost of tuition and fees at a public four year college ($5800).\n\"In the United States of America, every student should have the opportunity to go to college. It's the ticket to the middle class,\" said Sen. Biden. \"In today's global economy it is critical we provide a feasible way for the next generation to remain the most skilled workforce in the world.\"\nCollege ACCESS is just one component of what Biden believes is necessary to design a 21st century school system that will drive a knowledge-based, innovation-powered global economy. He has laid out four education goals: (1) starting earlier; (2) putting a well-paid, effective teacher in every classroom; (3) reducing class sizes; and (4) making sure every student graduates from high school and has the opportunity to go on to two or four years of college.\nContact: Annie Tomasini\n302-428-5427/ press@joebiden.com\n",

Biden also asked DNC Chairman Howard Dean to join him in his efforts.\nClick here to find the petition and add your voice to the debate.\nThe American people want to understand our plans for ending the Iraq war, and numerous news outlets all agree that Iraq is the defining issue of the upcoming Presidential election. As such, the Concord Monitor argued that, Joe Biden is absolutely right about one thing: 60 seconds is not enough time to debate the future of Iraq. He's called for a 90-minute debate on that one topic alone. The other candidates for president should sign on to the idea and find a television network willing to give them the airtime. [Concord Monitor, 5/2/07]\nDes Moines Regiser columnist David Yepsen also endorsed a debate on Iraq. Yepsen said that a debate should be held on Iraq and the U.S. role in the world.

It's sometimes not easy to compress how to fix Iraq into a 60-second answer. [CNN, 4/27/07]\nThe tragedy of our failed policy in Iraq has left the American people clamoring for a responsible dialogue, said Senator Biden in his letter to the Presidents of CBS, ABC, NBC and CNN. That is why I am asking you today to make at least one of these debates a 90-minute discussion solely devoted to ending the war in Iraq.\nClearly, you have the power to make this happen. I urge you to make your debate an Iraq-specific debate and work with the candidates and the DNC to make that happen, said Biden.\nCopies of the letters to the network Presidents and Chairman Dean are attached below.\nSent to:\nMr. Jonathan Klein\nPresident\nCNN\nMr. David Westin\nPresident\nABC News\nMr. Steve Capus\nPresident\nNBC News\nMr. Sean McManus\nPresident\nCBS News\nI want to congratulate you on your participation in the official Democratic debates to take place among our candidates for President beginning in July. The tragedy of our failed policy in Iraq has left the American people clamoring for a responsible dialogue by all of us on how we can bring our troops home and protect our interests in Iraq and in the region.\nThat is why I am asking you today to make at least one of these debates a 90-minute discussion solely devoted to ending the war in Iraq and the implications of our policy prescriptions for the world, the region, for Iraq and, most importantly, for our troops and the American people.\nThere is no question that how we leave Iraq will have serious consequences to the security of the region from Iran to our oil supply to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As Robert Gibbs, spokesman for Senator Obama, said after the South Carolina debate, 60 seconds is not enough to tackle the implications of the Bush Administrations record of failure in Iraq. The American people want to understand our plans for ending this war.\nBefore the South Carolina debate, I began my push for a 90-minute debate on Iraq. Shortly afterwards, The Concord (N.H.) Monitor editorialized in support of this idea, stating, Joe Biden is absolutely right about one thing: 60 seconds is not enough time to debate the future of Iraq.

The failure of the Bush Administration to respond to the will of the American people so clearly demonstrated in the results of the 2006 elections and end this failed policy in Iraq has created a mandate for our party to lead this country now and in the decades ahead to a new strategic vision for America.\nThat is why I am asking you today to help me push the network sponsors to make at least one of these debates a 90-minute discussion solely devoted to ending the war in Iraq and the implications for our policy prescriptions to the world, to the region, to Iraq and, most importantly, to our troops and the American people.\nThere is no question that how we leave Iraq will have serious consequences to the security of the region from Iran, to our oil supply to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

If the American people could vote today, they want President Bush out of office. But they are not voting until 2008.\nHowever, there are 21 Republican-held Senate seats that will be contested next year. The only way to get this President to change course is to continue putting relentless pressure on these Republican Senators to break with the President on his failed policy. A Democratic debate on Iraq would add to that pressure and demonstrate that we are united in our opposition to the war and on their side in this battle of political wills. In my view, getting the Republicans to break with the President is the only way to end this war before a new President is elected.\nGovernor Dean, the television networks have the power to make this happen. I am confident that all of our candidates for President would be willing and able to make their case on why we are best equipped to end this failed strategy and restore Americas place in the world. Please let me know how youd like to proceed.\nSincerely,\nSenator Joe Biden (D-DE)\nContact: Annie Tomasini or Mark Paustenbach\n302-428-5427/ Press@JoeBiden.com\n",

Biden on Darfur: \"The consensus among the American delegation, bipartisan delegation here, was that we cannot wait five or six or seven months for there to be any action taken on the ground [in Darfur]. There is a need to deal with stemming the bleeding. We know there's a need for a political solution, but you must must stem the bleeding now It is a disastrous, urgent situation that the international community has an obligation to respond to.\nWashington, DC - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) led a bipartisan delegation of Senate Foreign Relations Committee Members to the United Nations today. Sen. Biden, along with Senators Benjamin Cardin (D-MD), Norm Coleman (R-MN) and Bob Corker (R-TN) met with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, Ambassadors of the Permanent five members of the Security Council, President of the UN General Assembly Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa and U.S. Ambassador to the UN Zalmay Khalilzad <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalmay_Khalilzad> . The Senators discussed with UN officials the crisis in Darfur, UN Reform, violence in Lebanon, the increasing threat of Iran, the future of Kosovo and other international challenges.\nAfter the meetings with UN Officials, Senators Biden, Cardin and Corker held a media availability outside the United Nations Security Council Chamber. The following is a transcript of the media availability:\nSEN. BIDEN: Hello, my name is Joe Biden. I am with two of my colleagues. We came up to meet with the Secretary General. We just came out of a meeting with the President of the General Assembly as well as meeting with permanent members of the Security Council. We raised a number of issues. We were here to listen as well as to speak. We asked a lot of questions on issues that we raised in each of the meetings related to the hot spots that are of concern here at the United Nations, Darfur, Iran, the situation in Lebanon. We've even raised some questions about Iraq, but we had -- as they say, in diplomatic circles -- we had a frank and open exchange on these issues. But, it was very useful. It was very useful. One of the other things we talked about was U.N. reform, but I also pointed out to each of our interlocutors that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is going to be taking up a resolution providing for full funding of the United Nations to deal with what our [peacekeeping] arrearages are to deal with that. I expect to pass that out of the Committee this week and hopefully in the next intervening period for the budget process will be able to resolve that issue. As I said, we had good meetings, and the general point conveyed by us, as well as conveyed to us, is that the United States needs the United Nations, and United Nations needs the United States. And there is a process of adjusting to a very much a changed world here, and the question is, will the institution be able to do that? But let me yield to my colleagues for any comments they may have and then we will take a few questions.\nSEN. CARDIN: I am Ben Cardin. I am the Senator from Maryland. First, let me thank Senator Biden from the chairman of the foreign relations committee for arranging for us to come up to the -- to the United Nations. I think it was important what we stressed in strengthening the relationship between the United States and the United Nations and also strengthening the ties between the congress and the United Nations. We mentioned a lot of issues. I will emphasize one that I think it's the most urgent. That is the Darfur solution and moving forward in getting the troops on the ground the hybrid troops. That needs to take place and as quickly as possible. I must tell you I was encouraged by the comment I heard from the leadership here at the United Nations.\nSEN. CORKER: As a new member of the foreign relations committee, I have found this to be a very great trip to gain understanding. I especially enjoyed meeting with the Secretary General and certainly the Presidentof the general assembly, but I think the meeting we had with the other permanent members of the Security Council was probably most enlightening to me. As my colleagues have mentioned, certainly the specifics of Kosovo and Lebanon and Darfur certainly were discussed. But I think just, the overall effectiveness of the United Nations in dealing with the big issues of the day and the fact that it is important, especially with the conflicts and issues we have around the country, that the United Nations be effective in that regard. But again, our ambassador there, certainly as he does in every venue he goes to is very popular and well received here. We're glad to be with him and certainly found this morning's meetings to be very productive this morning.\nQUESTION: Your discussions on Darfur What did [you] ask the Secretary General to do on Darfur concerning sanctions or something along these lines?\nBIDEN: The three of us we wanted to -- the Secretary-General had asked for more time. He indicated to us what his efforts have been with Khartoum and to what stage things have progressed. The three of us, and another colleague who had to leave was with us as well, Senator Coleman, we made it very clear that this was of the highest priority to, in a bipartisan way in the United States Congress, it was genocide taking place, that both phase two and phase three of the UN resolution should be implemented immediately. We discussed how much time it would take to actually have a force of 23,000 people, starting at 17,000 hybrid force. We went into detail about what the command-and-control would be and the role of the United Nations in that effort. There seemed to be a mutual sense of urgency, both at the Security Council level as well as with the Secretary General. He has indicated that he has made this a priority. We had slightly different, not views, but nuanced assertions each of us made. But the bottom line was this -- there is a genocide taking place. The consensus among the American delegation, bipartisan delegation here, was that we cannot wait five or six or seven months for there to be any action taken on the ground. There is a need to deal with stemming the bleeding. We know there's a need for a political solution, but you must -- must stem the bleeding now. I have been there, as others have, I've been in Chad, I've been in the camps, I've met with the rebels. It is a disastrous, urgent situation that the international community has an obligation to respond to.\nQUESTION: There is a bill for full funding for the UN. I wonder if you can specifically comment on whether that includes the peacekeeping the mounting deficit to peacekeeping.\nSEN. BIDEN: Yes, it does.\nQUESTION: And how much are you looking to what kind of money are you looking at and what kind of timetable?\nBiden: The timetable is immediate. In other words, we would try to pass it for this fiscal year and I don't have in mind the exact number. 113 million. But the more important point is to agree to the 27%, then it is merely to -- one is to deal with the arrears, the others to make certain we do not further create as we go forward, other arrearages. The biggest ticket item will be moving from 25 to 27.\nQUESTION: Senator, thank you very much, you expect -- you said he discussed Lebanon with the secretary-general. How much are you concerned about the situation right now in Lebanon?\nSEN. BIDEN: I am not going to answer all the questions -- I should let my colleagues into them as well. We are very concerned about the situation in Lebanon. One of the things that the Senator Cardin and I'll ask him to speak to this -- that was raised in each of the [meetings] was the Lebanese/Syrian border. And weapons and material coming across that border. Do you want to speak to that, Ben?\nSEN. CARDIN: The United Nations has a mandate in Lebanon to allow the Lebanese to be able to control their country. We are obviously concerned about the most recent violence that has taken place and are concerned about the loss of life. And hope that that circumstance will be stabilized. The ongoing problem is the porous borders between Syria and Lebanon and Lebanon's ability to keep illegal arms out of their country in support with terrorist groups. I was pleased with the response I've gotten from the U.N. leadership that they understand this and are trying to work with the Lebanese and Syrians to work for an effective solution.\nQUESTION: [Inaudible] What about financing? These same groups are financed by Mr. Hariri himself and his group. Fatah and [inaudible] are financed as Mr. [inaudible] said it in his recent report in the New Yorker that these groups are financed by Hariri and the Saudis.\nSEN. CARDIN: We are concerned. I'm very concerned, and our country is concerned and the United Nations should be concerned about outside influences in Lebanon and the financing of a terrorist organization or extreme organizations. I think our top priority is to try to do something about the Syrian/Lebanese border in that regard. We still have a significant problem of stability within that country and the ability of the Lebanese to control their activities. We want to work with them, and we certainly want outside support for terrorist groups stopped.\nQUESTION: On Sudan, the real question is, you want action, you want to stem the bleeding right now -- without the consent of the government of Sudan, how can you do this and what is the United States prepared to do?\nSEN. BIDEN: I cannot speak for the President. I will not speak for the President or attempt to. The ambassador can, but the President has made it clear that sanctions and pre-sanctions are the next step if there is no action taken by consent from Sudan. I have a different view. I think nations, at some point, cede their sovereignty. When they engage in the genocide, they forfeit their sovereignty. That is speaking for Joe Biden, Senator Biden and no one else. And were I to make the decision, I would impose a no-fly zone immediately and commit forces to stop the Janjaweed now. But I am not making that decision. That is the decision that the President will have to make. But I do think that one of the things the international community is going [to have] to deal with over the next several years, starting with the permanent five and the Security Council at large and in the general assembly, is what constitutes the forfeiture of sovereignty. I am of the view that were I making the case, that when the international community concludes that a government is engaged in and/or allowing to happen within its borders genocidal behavior, it forfeits its sovereignty, giving the international community the right under international law to take action if it deems it fit to take action.\nQUESTION: Senator Biden, when you were talking about troops just now, were you talking about our troops, American troops?\nSEN. BIDEN: Joe Biden was, yes.\nQUESTION: Joe Biden was.\nSEN. BIDEN: Joe Biden, not the President.\nQUESTION: OK. Secondly, what did that -- what timeline did you get for the second and third phase, if Sudan approves -- well, they've approved the second...\nSEN. BIDEN: Well, the hope was expressed that we would get consent, that the international community would get consent, the U.N. would get consent from the government to begin to implement that right away, but it would take time. It would take some months for that to actually get troops on the ground, to get troops actually engaged in this peacekeeping effort. But the hope was that there would be a consent to begin that process relatively soon. That was the hope expressed by the secretary general.\nQUESTION: Follow up on Darfur, on that question: Did he indicate that President Bashir has given him assurances recently that he would do this? And, also, you mentioned that you discussed about how long it would take for the 23,000 troops, the full hybrid. How long did he say that would take?\nSEN. BIDEN: I will not speak to the first question. On the second question, as a practical matter, it was viewed that it would probably take some number of months -- less than a year but some number of months.\nQUESTION: Senator, about the peacekeeping budget, there is a $25, 25 percent...\nSEN. BIDEN: $25 -- I've got it right here. $25.\nQUESTION: Can I have it?\nSEN. BIDEN: Yes, you can.\nQUESTION: 25 percent cap that was exerted by Congress. Can you talk about that because the U.N.\nSEN. BIDEN: I'm going to lift -- I'm attempting to lift the cap.\nQUESTION: And get a new cap or just open to the sky?\nSEN. BIDEN: No, not unless you're willing to throw in your fortune, we're not going to open the sky.\nQUESTION: (inaudible) 25 bucks.\n(CROSSTALK)\nSEN. BIDEN: But as -- no, what we're attempting to do is move it to 27 percent.\nQUESTION: Senator, are you satisfied with the dynamics of Kosovo, how it's going here at the United Nations in the Security Council? Would you like to see it going more fast?\nSEN. BIDEN: I am, again, speaking only for myself, and this will be -- one more. But one of the things that -- to respond to your question, speaking for myself -- and I'd invite my colleagues to respond --there is a -- I was satisfied that there is a real sense of urgency. I was satisfied that a majority of the Security Council shares that sense of urgency. And I hopeful that there is a possibility that the plan put forward would be adopted. So I come away feeling better than when I arrived, but still not certain of the outcome. Anyone else want to comment?\n(CROSSTALK)\nQUESTION: Senator, what place do you see generally for legislative initiative or participation in foreign policy? And what do you think of the speaker's efforts in this regard and the Republican reaction to them?\nSEN. BIDEN: Yes, yes and no.\n(LAUGHTER)\nThank you all very much.\nEND\n",

    "text": "\nWashington, DC - U.S. Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) called on the President today to make building and deploying Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicles a national priority.\n\"Road-side bombs are responsible for 70 percent of casualties in Iraq and these new Mine Resistant Vehicles can reduce those casualties by two-thirds. I've been a big proponent of getting more Mine Resistant vehicles into the field as soon as possible, authoring an amendment to the Iraq Supplemental which accelerated funding for them. I'll continue to fight to do what's necessary to keep our soldiers safe but why haven't we heard from the Administration about this? Where is its leadership when we need it?\" asked Senator Biden.\nThe Marine Corps ordered their first MRAPs on May 21, 2006 185 vehicles. But according to a Marine Corps document leaked yesterday, commanders in the field in Iraq first asked for MRAPs in February, 2005 -- more than a year earlier. That request for 1,169 vehicles was labeled \"priority 1 urgent.\" According to today's news reports, the military failed to act on that 2005 request, delaying by more than a year getting these lifesaving vehicles into the field.\nThe urgent request for MRAPS, dated February 17, 2005 said: \"There is an immediate need for an MRAP vehicle capability to increase survivability and mobility of Marines operating in a hazardous fire area against known threats The expanded use of improvised explosive devices requires a more robust family of vehicles capable of surviving MRAP-designed vehicles represent a significant increase in their survivability baseline over existing motor vehicle equipment and will mitigate casualties Without MRAPs, perso nnel loss rates are likely to continue at their current rates. MRAP vehicles will protect Marines, reduce casualties, increase mobility and enhance mission success.\"\n\"It's easy to throw around words like outrageous and shocking but this is both,\" said Sen. Biden. \"We were told that Marine Corps commanders in Iraq made the first request for Mine Resistant Vehicles on May 21, 2006, for 185 vehicles. Now we learn that Marines on the ground in Iraq made an urgent request to their commanders for 1169 Mine Resistant Vehicles as early as February 2005 but nothing happened. How is it possible that a request that is literally life or death got lost? How is it possible that with the nation at war, with more than 130,000 Americans in danger, with roadside bombs taking more and more lives and limbs, this administration did not make these Mine Resistant Vehicles a national priority?\"\n\"President Bush should get us answers to these questions so that we never have to ask them again,\" said Sen. Biden. \"We need a plan and it must start with the President of the United States. First, the President should declare, personally, that getting as many Mine Resistant vehicles as we need into the field as soon as possible is a national priority. Second, the President should order the Secretary of Defense to determine by June 15 how many additional Mine Resistant vehicles we need, and to produce a plan to make them and to overcome any production obstacles that might stand in the way. Third, the President should make it clear that he will use all of his authority to break any logjams and get the job done. Fourth, the President and Congress should pledge that whatever money is needed to build the additional MRAPs will be made available no 'ifs-ands-or-buts.'\"\n\"No matter what Americans think about this war, every one of us agrees on this: so long as a single American soldier is on the front lines, it is our shared responsibility to protect him with every last bit of our energy, our ingenuity, our determination. That's the American way,\" added Sen. Biden.\nSen. Biden has been a staunch proponent of getting more Mine Resistant vehicles on the ground in Iraq as soon as possible. Sen. Biden introduced his amendment to the Senate's FY 2007 Supplemental Appropriations Bill on March 28, 2007. The amendment accelerated MRAP funding to meet the military's growing need for these life-saving vehicles by adding $1.5 billion to the emergency spending bill that will be sent to the president this week. The Biden amendment passed the Senate the next day, 98-0. Sen. Biden's amendment means the military should be able to deploy 2,500 more MRAPs into the field six-months sooner than planned.\n",

Much of our aid is being used to build local and provincial governments, consistent with the federalism-based political solution I advocate.\n\"But the practical reality is that, for now, those of us who want to change course in Iraq don't have the votes to override the President's veto.

Biden, Jr. (D-DE) issued the following statement today after President Bush's press conference:\n\"Iraq has become a Bush-fulfilling prophecy. Al-Qaeda wasn't there before the war, but it is there now. It is a problem, but not the primary problem. The President is handing Al-Qaeda a propaganda victory by exaggerating its role in Iraq. The sectarian war Sunnis and Shiites killing each other is the core problem and our troops are caught in the middle of it. New statistics from Iraq make clear that sectarian violence is getting worse and now exceeds levels immediately prior to the surge.\n\"The President's focus on Al-Qaeda in Iraq ironically supports exactly what I have been arguing for. We need to dramatically limit the mission of our troops in Iraq, getting them out from the middle of the sectarian civil war and refocusing their mission on battling Al-Qaeda and training Iraqis. That would require far fewer troops and allow us to get most of them out early next year. Our troops can't end the sectarian war. That requires a political solution even as we continue to take on Al-Qaeda.\n\"The President continues to bank on the far-fetched hope that Iraqis will rally behind a strong, democratic, central government in Iraq. But there is no trust within the government, no trust of the government by the people, and no capacity by the government to deliver security or services. And there is no prospect it will build that trust and capacity any time soon. Instead, the President should throw the full weight of his office behind a solution based on federalism allowing Iraqis to have control over the fabric of their lives at the local level. We shouldn't impose this and we don't need to it's already in the Iraqi Constitution. The President should call for a UN summit, to get the world's major powers and Iraq's neighbors to push for a political agreement.\"\n",

The ad can be viewed on the Biden for President website at: www.joebiden.com/mrap.\nThe ad, which features April Shacklee, whose husband Michael is a Black Hawk Pilot for the U.S. Army currently serving in Iraq for the past seven months, focuses on Biden's work to get MRAP vehicles, which provide four to five times the protection from IEDs than up-armored humvees (HMMWVs), into the field in Iraq.\nWith as many casualties that you hear about from roadside bombs, you would think that anything that they could do to lessen that number to possibly prevent that from happening as often as it does why arent they doing something about it?, Shacklee says in the ad.\nIn a press conference last Wednesday, Biden, who has been a staunch proponent of getting more of these vehicles into the field as soon as possible, called on Bush to make this a national priority. This call came after a Marine Corps document was leaked showing that commanders in Iraq first asked for 1,169 MRAP vehicles in February, 2005 yet this request, labeled \"priority 1 urgent,\" wasnt acted upon for more than a year.

How is it possible that with the nation at war, with more than 130,000 Americans in danger, with roadside bombs taking more and more lives and limbs, this administration did not make these Mine Resistant Vehicles a national priority?, said Biden at the press conference.\nOn Thursday, in a statement on the Senate floor after voting for the Iraq Emergency Supplemental Bill, Biden said, If we don't get the money this bill provides into the pipeline right now, we will not be able to build and field the Mine Resistant vehicles that I've been fighting for, and that can cut American deaths and casualties from road side bombs by two-thirds.\nAs long as a single soldier is there, I will do everything I can to make sure he or she has the best protection this country can provide. That's my reality. As I demonstrated on Thursday with my vote, I will not cut funding for the troops that denies them the equipment they need to be safe. I don't care what the politics are of that decision. The president may be prepared to play a game of political chicken with the well-being of our armed forces. I am not.\nShacklee, the mother of two young children, concludes the ad by saying, I would like to thank Senator Biden for having a plan to protect our troops while they are over there and for ultimately having a viable plan for getting them out. I can't tell you I can't explain how valuable it will be to have my husband home, to know that when my girls wake up in the morning, Daddys going to be there again.\n\nFull Transcript:\nMy name is April Shacklee. My husband is currently in Iraq.\nWhen my daughters are asking, you know, Is Daddy coming home, and I don't know what to tell them, because I don't know.\nWith as many casualties that you hear about from roadside bombs, you would think that anything that they could do to lessen that number to possibly prevent that from happening as often as it does why arent they doing something about it?\nAnd it would be nice to know that going from one place to another that he was protected more than he is right now.\nI would like to thank Senator Biden for having a plan to protect our troops while they are over there and for ultimately having a viable plan for getting them out.\nI can't tell you I can't explain how valuable it will be to have my husband home, to know that when my girls wake up in the morning, Daddys going to be there again.\n",

We should enforce a No-Fly Zone, impose multilateral sanctions through the U.N., lead negotiations among all the parties for a lasting peace settlement, find the forces for a peacekeeping mission, and, if necessary, commit U.S. troops on the ground. I recognize that there are logistical obstacles and humanitarian concerns involved in this approach specifically with imposing a No Fly Zone. International assistance to Darfur hangs by a thread and we must take careful steps to ensure that aid continues to reach those in need.\n\"The United Nations has authorized a peacekeeping mission of 20,000 troops and additional police forces for Sudan. I recently met with the U.N. Secretary General and urged him to move rapidly to raise these forces and get them into Darfur. The international community must step up to its responsibility and deploy the troops and equipment. Peace in Darfur requires a global response. The U.S. can and will play a major role, but so must the United Nations and the African Union. We also need a sustained, coordinated diplomatic effort, which will bring the rebels together and build a lasting peace that works for the people of Darfur.\"\n",

The debate, which will be sponsored by the Financial Times and the Center on Politics and Foreign Relations at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), is the first opportunity in this campaign cycle for the candidates to debate the War in Iraq.\nSenator Biden appreciates the opportunity SAIS is providing the candidates, an opportunity in which they can stand up and give substantive and thorough answers to the most pressing issue on the minds of voters the war in Iraq, said Biden for President Campaign Manager Luis Navarro. So far, the candidates have only had the time to answer in sound bites, and that is just not good enough for the American people. That is why it is critical for all of the Democratic candidates for President to accept SAIS invitation. Senator Biden will be there, even if he's the only one on stage.\nSen. Biden has been at the forefront in calling for an exclusive debate and discussion about the war in Iraq among all the Democratic candidates for President. Last month, following the first Democratic debate at South Carolina State University, Sen. Biden launched a national petition, 60 Seconds is Not Enough and called on the television networks to sponsor a 90-minute debate on Iraq. Sen. Biden also urged Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean to help make such an event a reality. Contact:\nAnnie Tomasini/Mark Paustenbach\n302-428-5427/ Press@JoeBiden.com\n",

    "text": "\n\"When they give the ultimate sacrifice for our well-being, we have an absolute obligation to make sure we do all we can for their loved ones.\"\nWilmington, DE - Senator Joe Biden, co-chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, today urged Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to follow the guidelines designated by the Hometown Heroes Act, guaranteeing that families of public service members who lost their lives in the line of duty are able to receive compensation in a timely manner.\nThe past few years have seen a significant delay in families receiving the benefits that Congress unanimously approved over three years ago. In 2004, it was mandated that all claims should receive a decision within 90 days. Yet today, three years after President Bush signed the Hometown Heroes Act, 80 percent of claims remain pending.\n\"The safety of our families rests on the strong shoulders of our firefighters, police, and paramedics,\" said Senator Biden. \"When they give the ultimate sacrifice for our well-being, we have an absolute obligation to make sure we do all we can for their loved ones. The Department of Justice needs to respond to these claims in a timely manner, as they promised they would.\"\nSenator Biden was joined in signing the letter to Gonzales by all eight co-chairs of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus - whose 319 members make it the largest caucus in Congress. The letter is below:\nThe Honorable Alberto R. Gonzales\nUnited States Department of Justice\n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW\nWashington, DC 20530\nDear Attorney General Gonzales:\nAs co-chairs of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, the largest caucus in Congress, we are writing to express our concern over the Department of Justices (DOJ) protracted implementation of the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Act (PL 108-182). With the DOJ having made only two positive determinations out of approximately 250 claims under the Hometown Heroes provisions of the Public\n--more--\nSafety Officers Benefits (PSOB) program, our constituents within the nation's fire and emergency services are expressing frustration that DOJ may be misinterpreting the intent of Congress.\nThe Hometown Heroes Act, approved unanimously by both the Senate and House more than three years ago, reflects the intention of Congress to provide a \"presumptive benefit\" to the families of public safety officers who suffer a fatal heart attack or stroke in the line of duty unless there is strong evidence to the contrary. The Act states:\n\"if a public safety officer dies as the direct and proximate result of a heart attack or stroke, that officer shall be presumed to have died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty, if -\n(1) that officer, while on duty -\n(A) engaged in a situation, and such engagement involved nonroutine stressful or strenuous physical law enforcement, fire suppression, rescue, hazardous material response, emergency medical services, prison security, disaster relief, or other emergency response activity; or\n(B) participated in a training exercise. (42 U.S.C. 3796 (k))\"\nThe presumption of death is clearly defined in the law, the accompanying floor statements, and other legislative history.\nThe legislation was motivated by the noble acts of our law enforcement officers, firefighters, and other public safety officers who place themselves in harms way every day. Many of the actions they undertake in the line of duty are of an extremely taxing nature. A recent Harvard University study concluded that firefighters are up to 100 times at greater risk of suffering a fatal heart attack or stroke while engaging in emergency response. These men and women, who serve our country and their communities selflessly, deserve no less than our full support in ensuring their families are cared for when they make the ultimate sacrifice.\nIn 2004, your predecessor, Attorney General Ashcroft, mandated that all claims filed under the PSOB should be processed in no more than 90 days. More than three years have elapsed since President Bush signed the Hometown Heroes Act into law, and more than eight months since DOJ finalized its rule on the laws implementation, and yet 80 percent of the claims remain pending. The families of public safety officers who have given their lives in the line of duty deserve proper treatment from the Justice Department by having their claims acted on in a timely manner and according to the requirements of the Hometown Heroes Act. We ask that you undertake an immediate review of this program to ensure that the Hometown Heroes provision of the PSOB program is being implemented in accordance with the intent of Congress.\nThank you in advance for your consideration of these requests. We look forward to your prompt response.\n",

Governor Patricks proposal would eventually make his states community colleges free to all of Massachusetts high school graduates by 2015. The plan would also provide preschool for all children and lengthen the school day as well as the school year.\nGovernor Patricks plan is right on the money. I applaud Governor Patricks efforts to make our schools the best they can be and to give students in Massachusetts the tools they need to compete in todays global economy, said Senator Biden. This is great progress and these efforts should be replicated across the country. Like Governor Patrick, I remain committed to making our education system better, and I believe my college affordability plan provides the means to make a college education a reality for all students, no matter what their economic means are.\nSenator Biden has long supported making our schools better and making college education accessible for all students. Senator Biden's College ACCESS plan includes a credit that would cover the average cost of tuition at a public two-year college and would cover approximately half of the average cost of tuition at a public four-year college. The Biden plan consolidates two existing tax incentives the Hope Scholarship Credit and the tuition and fees deduction and replaces them with a single $3,000 refundable tax credit that is the equivalent of a $12,000 deduction. Efforts to expand income limits allows most families to be eligible for the tax credit and making the credit refundable allows families of all income backgrounds to get the same benefit. Simplifying the existing higher education tax incentives will also make it easier for families to understand and navigate the maze of incentives.\nIn addition, Senator Biden's College ACCESS Plan would immediately increase the maximum Pell Grant to $5,100. This change would be followed by further increases of $300 per year for the next five years. Senator Biden's plan will also begin the college conversation with students earlier by committing Pell Grants to students in the 8th grade.\n",

    "text": "\nWashington, DC - U.S. Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, renewed his call to fully fund the successful COPS program in light of today's FBI annual report detailing nationwide increases in violent crime for the second consecutive year.\n\"This report should be a wake up call to the Bush Administration,\" said Senator Biden. \"For years we drove down the crime rates but now we're in reverse gear. And it's no coincidence that it's happened during the same time period which the Administration has all but eliminated the COPS program, slashed state and local law enforcement programs by billions and cut completely the COPS hiring program. This Administration has repeatedly ignored the needs to law enforcement, giving short shrift to the men and women who keep us safe everyday.\"\nThe FBI released today its 2006 preliminary crime report based on data from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) database. For the second year in a row, there were measurable increases in violent crime nationwide. This is the first time the crime rate has risen for two consecutive years since the passage of the 1994 Biden Crime Bill. Small and mid-sized cities experienced increases in the number of murders and robberies, with violent crimes increasing 1.3 percent. In 2005, the FBI found that murders were up 3.4 percent the largest percentage increase in 15 years with 16,692 murders in 2005 the most since 1998. Violent crime refers to acts of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.\n\"More than a decade ago, we faced a similar violent crime crisis,\" said Sen. Biden. \"We overcame it by supporting local law enforcement and passing the most sweeping anti-crime bill in our history, creating the Community Oriented Policing Services Program the COPS program. We funded 118,000 local officers, expanding community policing across the nation. And it worked crime rates fell for eight straight years. Violent crime dropped 26 percent; the murder rate dropped 34 percent.\"\n\"We know how to fix the problem,\" said Sen. Biden. \"It's time to get back to crime-fighting basics that means more cops on the streets, equipped with the tools and resources they need to keep our neighborhoods safe. We do that by fully funding the COPS program.\nThe Brookings Institution published a policy briefing this spring (March 2007 Briefing #158) entitled, \"MORE COPS.\" The authors, Yale economist John Donohue, III and Georgetown economist Jens Ludwig found that the COPS program contributed to the drop in crime during the 1990s and is one of the most cost-effective options for fighting crime. The policy briefing states that each $1.4 billion invested in the COPS program is likely to generate a benefit to society from $6 billion to $12 billion.\nOn May 23, Sen. Biden chaired a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs about the federal role in helping communities prevent and respond to violent crime. Across the board, leaders of national law enforcement organizations, including the National Sheriffs Association, the National Association of Police Organizations, the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the U.S. Conference of Mayors, concurred that budgetary cuts to the Community Oriented Policing Service (COPS) program, created by Senator Biden in 1994, have contributed to the rise in violent crime and adversely affected local crime prevention and local law enforcement initiatives.\nAt the hearing, Senator Biden said, \"The federal government has taken its focus off street crime since 9/11, asking law enforcement to do more with less ... fewer police on the street preventing crime and protecting communities means more crime it's as simple that.\"\nThe UCR Program was created in 1929 by the International Association of Chiefs of Police to provide reliable, standardized crime statistics for the nation. Each year, nearly 17,000 law enforcement agencies voluntarily provide crime reporting data, and this information is compiled to evaluate and track the levels and types of crimes committed in the county. For over 70 years, the FBI has collected and published these statistics. To read the report, visit: http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/06prelim/pressrelease.htm. More comprehensive statistics will be available in September when the FBI publishes Crime in the United States, 2006, on its UCR Web site.\nSen. Biden, former Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and author of the 1994 Crime Bill, has continuously fought efforts by the Bush Administration to cut back federal funding for local law enforcement. In recent years, the Administration has eliminated billions in guaranteed federal funding for local law enforcement and the FBI has largely transitioned from domestic crime fighting to counter-terrorism, creating a gap that has hindered law enforcement's ability to combat crime. To re-establish the Federal, State and local partnership that helped reduce crime to historic lows in the 1990s, Senator Biden has introduced legislation this year to restore the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services and to add 1,000 additional FBI agents to ensure the FBI's capacity to fight crime and combat terrorism. The House of Representatives recently passed the House-version of Sen. Biden's bill to hire an additional 50,000 police officers in communities across America.\n",

    "text": "\nWASHINGTON, DC - In a letter sent to President Bush today, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-DE) called for U.S. participation in the development of a multilateral response to global warming at the G8 Summit this week. The effort, led by Chairman Biden, Senators Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), urges President Bush to engage his counterparts at the G8 constructively in order to reach consensus on global solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.\nThere is scientific consensus that global warming is real and caused by human action. There is mounting concern that it poses threats to our national security. In this context, it is astonishing that the U.S. would take anything but a leadership role in addressing climate change at the G8 this week. President Bush has offered promising rhetoric, but has been short of real commitments and specifics. I hope the U.S. can be a consensus builder in this weeks G8 discussions, not a roadblock, said Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joe Biden.\n\"The Heiligendamm Conference presents an exceptional opportunity for the President to exhibit the scale of leadership that reflects the scope of the problem of climate change, said Senator Snowe. I believe that Chancellor Merkel has proposed a constructive framework that produces tangible results and it is incumbent on the President to either work within this framework or propose an alternative. Postponing this issue for a future summit would be a disservice in establishing American leadership on this critical issue and I implore the President to rise to this momentous occasion,\" said Senator Snowe.\nThe G8 Summit in Heiligendamm presents an excellent opportunity for our nation to re-engage in a meaningful way on global climate change, said Senator Bingaman. While rapidly developing nations must also be a part of this discussion, I along with the bipartisan group that signed this letter continue to hope that the Administration will show leadership by setting and committing our country to emission reduction targets, and by working constructively with other G8 countries in addressing the challenges of global warming.\nThe text of the letter follows:\nJune 4, 2007\nThe President The White House Washington, D.C. 20500\nMr. President:\nWith the approach of the G8 Summit in Heiligendamm, Germany, in June, we are writing to urge constructive engagement by the United States in the development of a joint communiqu on the issue of climate change. Chancellor Merkel, current President of the G8 and host of the Summit, has proposed a set of principles to guide the development of an effective multilateral response to global warming. We believe your support for a clear consensus on those principles could advance the interests of the United States and could open the door to the meaningful participation of developing nations in a global solution to this global problem.\nThose principles are: the enunciation of a long-term goal to guide international action on climate change; the use of emissions trading and other market-based mechanisms to provide economic incentives for the most efficient paths to emissions reductions; the development and deployment of clean energy technologies, an area in which the United States has the opportunity to become a world leader; the avoidance of deforestation, a major source of greenhouse gas emissions; and stronger international support for adaptation to climate change, particularly in disadvantaged countries that are most vulnerable to climate impacts and are least able to adapt.\nWe believe consensus on these principles would put us on a path toward a more inclusive and effective multilateral approach, one that protects and enhances the economic security of our country, provides flexibility for nations to pursue different policy approaches, engages the efficiency and ingenuity of the private sector, and secures commitments by all major emitting nations, both developed and developing.\nWe appreciate that there are other issues of significant importance to be discussed at Heiligendamm. We also recognize that progress on climate change discussions can contribute to consensus on the wider range of items on the Summits agenda.\nMr. President, you have made clear that you understand the challenge climate change poses to our nation and our planet. To meet this challenge, both the United States and developing nations, five of whom will participate in the proceedings at Heiligendamm, must join in the solution. Your leadership in the search for consensus will be essential to a successful outcome and we hope you feel, as we do, the great urgency to move forward on worldwide greenhouse gas emissions reductions.\nThank you for considering our views. We look forward to a successful outcome from the 33rd G8 Summit.\nSincerely,\nSenator Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Chairman\nSenator Olympia Snowe\nSenator Jeff Bingaman\nSenator Barbara Boxer\nSenator John F. Kerry\nSenator Dianne Feinstein\nSenator Benjamin L. Cardin\nSenator Sherrod Brown\nSenator Arlen Specter\nSenator Joe Lieberman\nSenator Bernie Sanders\nSenator Robert Menendez\nSenator Russ Feingold\nSenator Maria Cantwell\nSenator Robert Casey\nSenator Dick Durbin\nSenator Ken Salazar\nSenator Amy Klobuchar\nSenator Ron Wyden\nSenator Ted Kennedy\n",

    "text": "\n(Wilmington, DE June 5, 2007) - Senator Joe Biden continues to garner excellent reviews following his second straight successful debate performance. Columnists and key political reporters recognize Senator Biden's wealth of experience and his steadfast leadership on a host issues important to the American people.\nWashington Post columnist E.J. Dionne noted that, Biden was the most passionate, straight-talking figure on the stage here at Saint Anselm College. Dionne praised Senator Biden's stance on Darfur and his clear opposition to the law banning gays in the military. Senator Biden's decision to vote to fund our troops in Iraq and his defense of his vote without hedges or equivocation, was applauded by Dionne. [Washington Post, 6/5/07]\nSteven Thomma of McClatchy News endorsed the notion of debates focused on one issue, so that candidates could speak at length, allowing moderators to probe all the candidates and points of view. Thomma also used the example of an Iraq-specific debate and noted that one will take place tomorrow in Washington, DC, sponsored by the Financial Times and the Center on Politics and Foreign Relations at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). All leading Democratic candidates for President have been invited to participate. Senator Joe Biden first proposed the idea during a debate weeks ago and is the only leading Democratic candidate for President to have accepted their invitation to discuss his plan for Iraq. Thomma praised the event and described it as serious people holding a debate on the most pressing issue of our time. [McClatchy News, 6/5/07]\nNew York Times columnist David Brooks offered a detailed analysis of the state of affairs in Iraq and positively noted Senator Biden's plan for that country. Senator Joe Biden is the only Democratic candidate for President to offer a real plan to get our troops out of the middle of the Iraqi civil war. His plan would maintain a unified Iraq by decentralizing it and giving the Kurds, Shiites and Sunnis local control over their daily lives. Senator Biden's plan also calls for a major diplomatic offensive to enlist the support of Iraq's neighbors and create an Oversight Group of the U.N. and the major powers to enforce their commitments. Senator Biden's plan asks our military to draw up plans to responsibly withdraw most U.S. forces from Iraq by 2008 - enough time for the political settlement to take hold - while leaving a small force behind to take on terrorists and train Iraqis.\n",

    "text": "\nI want to thank the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins and the Financial Times for bringing us here tonight.\nIraq dominates our national debate.\nI believe it deserves at least one debate of its own among those running for President.\nSo I was very pleased when the FT and SAIS invited us to a debate exclusively on Iraq.\nIm disappointed that most of my colleagues declined to join me, especially before such an informed audience. But maybe together, even without the others, we can advance the national debate on Iraq.\n* * *\nEvery Democrat running for President agrees: the war in Iraq must end.\nBut it matters profoundly how we end it. It matters to our soldiers. It matters to Iraqis. And it matters to Americas future security.\nI have a comprehensive strategy to end the war responsibly. It has three parts: (i) a roadmap to bring most of our troops home next year; (ii) a detailed plan for what we leave behind; and (iii) a commitment that, so long as a single American soldier remains in Iraq, we will do everything in our power to protect him.\nEach piece is critical. It is not enough to do one without the others. Let me talk about each part of my comprehensive approach.\nI. Bring the Troops Home\nFirst, instead of escalating the war with no end in sight, we have to start to bring our troops home now, and withdraw most of them next year.\nThe best way to do that is to repeal the 2002 authorization to use force in Iraq. We gave the president that power to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and, if necessary, to end Saddam Hussein's regime.\nThe WMD were not there and Saddam is no longer there. The 2002 authorization is totally irrelevant to the reality of Iraq.\nIn its place, we should dramatically limit the mission of our troops in Iraq to get them out of the middle of a sectarian civil war and to focus them on the much narrower, achievable and necessary mission of denying Al Qaeda territory, training Iraqis and protecting themselves.\nIf we limit the mission in that way, there will be no need to keep anywhere near 150,000 Americans in Iraq especially at a time when our military is dangerously over-stretched, threatening the readiness, retention and recruitment of our armed forces and their ability to deal with other hot spots.\nTwo weeks ago, I introduced a law to repeal the 2002 use of force authorization, to transition the mission of our troops and to bring most of our forces home next year. I will push relentlessly until Republicans stop supporting the President and start backing a responsible path out of Iraq.\nThat's how we will end this war.\nII. A Plan for What We Leave Behind\nGetting our troops out of Iraq is necessary but it is not enough.\nWe also need a plan for what we leave behind, so that we don't trade a dictator for chaos in Iraq and the Middle East. If that happens, we may get our children out but their children will have to go back in.\nEvery Democrat agrees that there is no purely military solution for Iraq. We need a political settlement that brings stability to Iraq.\nDespite that broad agreement, only two people have offered a detailed plan to produce such a settlement. Im one of them. The other is Les Gelb of the Council on Foreign Relations. Together, a year ago, we proposed a detailed plan for a political settlement in Iraq. Go to planforiraq.com. to read its details.\nThe fundamental problem in Iraq is self-sustaining sectarian violence. Sunnis killing Shiites, and Shiites killing Sunnis is the heart of the matter.\nHistory suggests that there are four ways to stop a sectarian cycle of revenge.\nFirst, a bloodletting that leaves one side victorious or both sides exhausted. In the case of Iraq, that could take years years we do not have and should not accept.\nSecond, an open-ended foreign occupation that America cannot sustain.\nThird, the return of a strongman, who is not on the horizon. Even if he were, it would be a tragic irony to replace one dictator with another.\nOr fourth, a political agreement to form a decentralized, federal system of government that separates the warring factions and gives them breathing room in their own regions.\nA decade ago, I was deeply involved in trying to shape our policy toward Bosnia. That country was being torn apart by ethnic cleansing, which threatened to engulf the Balkans. The U.S. stepped in with the Dayton Accords. They kept the country whole by, paradoxically, dividing it into ethnic federations. Muslims, Croats and Serbs retained separate armies and presidents. Since then, Bosnians have lived a decade in peace. Now, they are slowly coming back together.\nIraq presents a similar possibility... and the only opportunity we have left.\n* * *\nOur plan has five major pieces.\nFirst, maintain a unified Iraq by decentralizing it as the Iraqi constitution provides -- and bringing decisions down to the local level. Give Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds control over the fabric of their daily lives: security, education, marriage, jobs. Limit the central government to common concerns, like guarding Iraq's borders and distributing its oil revenues.\nSecond, secure support from the Sunnis who have no oil by guaranteeing them a fair share of oil revenues.\nThird, increase, don't end, economic assistance to Iraq and its regions. Insist that oil-rich Gulf states put up most of the money ... tie it to the protection of minority rights... and create a major jobs program to deny the militia new recruits.\nFourth, initiate a major diplomatic offensive to enlist the support of the worlds major powers and Iraq's neighbors for a political settlement. Create an oversight group at the U.N. to enforce the neighbors commitments. These countries have a profound stake in preventing chaos in Iraq -- and the credibility we lack to press for compromise by all Iraqis.\nFifth, instruct the U.S. military to draw up plans for withdrawing U.S. combat forces from Iraq by 2008. Leave behind a small force to take on terrorists and train Iraqis.\nIf we fail to make federalism work, there will be no political accommodation at the center. Violent resistance will increase. The sectarian cycle of revenge will spiral out of control.\nThe result will be at best the violent break up of Iraq into multiple states at worst the total fragmentation of the country.\nThe neighbors will not sit on the sidelines. Already, Iraq has aggravated a deep Sunni-Shiite divide that runs from Lebanon through the Gulf States and into south Asia. This fault-line intersects with other cultural and political rifts between Arabs and Persians ...Turks and Kurds ... jihadis and moderates to create the conditions for an explosion. That would do terrible damage to American interests.\nFederalism is our best hope for stability in Iraq and the region. It offers the possibility not the guarantee of producing a soft landing.\nSenators Sam Brownback, Barbara Boxer, Bill Nelson, Gordon Smith and I will introduce a bi-partisan bill to make it U.S. policy to actively support a political settlement in Iraq based on a federal system.\n* * *\nThe Bush administration has another vision for Iraq. But the entire premise of its policy is fundamentally and fatally flawed.\nIt believes Iraqis will rally behind a strong central government that keeps the country together and protects the rights of all citizens equally.\nBut there is no trust within the central government... no trust of the government by the people... and no capacity by the government to deliver services and security. And there is no evidence none that we can build that trust and capacity any time soon.\nUnfortunately, even some of my Democratic colleagues share this same flawed premise, though it leads them to a very different prescription.\nWhereas the President is escalating the war to give the central government a chance to succeed, some of my colleagues believe that the mere fact of pulling our troops out will force the central government to act responsibly.\nThey, too, buy into the fallacy that Iraq can be run from the center and that it will be as soon as we take the training wheels off.\nThey, too, are wrong.\nEscalating the war -- or ending it without a clear plan for what we leave behind is not the way to protect Americas interests.\nIII. Protect Every Soldier\nI'll conclude with the third piece of my comprehensive strategy to end the war in Iraq.\nIt is this: so long as we have a single soldier left in Iraq, it is our most sacred responsibility to give him the best protection this country can provide.\nThat's why I voted for the emergency Supplemental bill two weeks ago.\nWithout the money it provides, we wont be able to build and send to Iraq things like Mine Resistant vehicles that I have been fighting to fund.\nRoadside bombs are responsible for 70 percent of American casualties and deaths in Iraq. These mine resistant vehicles offer 4 to 5 times the protection of a Humvee they can cut casualties and deaths by seventy percent.\nI fought to front load money in the emergency spending bill for these vehicles. I convinced my colleagues to back me. As a result, we will get 2,500 more of these vehicles to Iraq by the end of the year than we otherwise would have.\nTo delay building them by weeks or months to make a political point that would not have ended the war would have been unconscionable.\nThe President may be prepared to play a game of political chicken with the safety of our soldiers.\nI am not and I will not.\n* * *\nLet me conclude where I started. The war in Iraq must end. But it matters profoundly how we end it.\nI'm proposing a comprehensive strategy to bring our troops home, to leave behind a stable Iraq and to protect our men and women in uniform so long as a single one of them remains in Iraq.\nThis is the strategy I would implement as President.\nBut by the time I become President, it will almost certainly be too late. We need to move on this strategy now. If we don't, then our only option will be to disengage completely and try to contain the fall out within Iraq.\nBut let me leave that strategy for another day and turn to your questions and comments. Thanks for listening.\n",

But we owe it to the people we serve to work through our differences and ultimately resolve this problem. Thats why I voted to keep working on the bill this issue is too important to just quit on.\n###\nSenator Biden voted in favor on the motion to proceed to the Comprehensive Immigration Bill.\n",

    "text": "\nWashington, DC - U.S. Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) introduced legislation today to increase the use of compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs), which are longer-lasting and more energy-efficient than regular incandescent bulbs. The Flip-to-Save program will provide grants to states to distribute CFLs as part of statewide education campaigns about the savings from switching to CFLs and energy efficient technology.\nBy simply changing a light bulb, we can save green in two waysreduce pollution and save money at the same time, said Senator Biden. Our Flip the Switch campaign in Delaware gave out 140,000 of these new light bulbs last year, showing consumers how to reduce environmental damage while saving money on electricity costs. By bringing Delawares model program to the rest of the country, we can drastically reduce our carbon dioxide emissions.\nAccording to the Energy Information Administration at the Department of Energy, American families use about 1.4 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity every year, spending approximately $130 billion. Whats worse: this demand for electricity is expected to grow by over 30 percent by 2025. But many Americans dont realize that simple changes, such as replacing incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs), can drastically reduce both of these figures. In fact, switching just one incandescent bulb with a CFL can save approximately 1000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions over the lifetime of the bulb. If every family across the US replaces just one regular incandescent bulb with a CFL, we can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 7 million tons per year.\nBy educating consumers across America on the changes they can make, we have the opportunity to drastically scale back our energy consumption and improve our environment. To me, its a no-brainer, said Senator Biden.\nToday, many consumers are unfamiliar with CFLs and many more, especially low-income families, are put off by their high price tag. But over time CFLs save money because they last longer and use only a quarter of the energy of a regular bulb. The Flip-to-Save program will provide $50 million in funding to states to administer programs to educate consumers and distribute CFL light bulbs.\nSpecifically, Flip-to-Save will:\n* Replace more than 16 million incandescent bulbs with highly efficient bulbs\n* Save a total of $60 million dollars in electrical bills each year. Replacing one 60-Watt incandescent light-bulb with a CFL saves $25-$36 per bulb.\n* Save the equivalent of enough electricity to power 127,000 homes a city about the size of Buffalo.\n* Prevent 1.1 million tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. Half of our electricity each year comes from coal plants ? some 2 trillion kilowatt-hours ? which emit 4 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year.\n",

    "text": "\n\nBipartisan Group of Senators Introduce Resolution Calling for U.S. to Support a Federal System in Iraq Separating the Warring Parties, with a Limited Central Government\n\nWashington, DC - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) and Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS) Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Bill Nelson (D-FL) and Gordon Smith (R-OR) introduced a resolution today calling for the United States and the international community including the UN Security Council and Iraqs neighbors to support an Iraqi political settlement based on federalism.\nThe Presidents policy in Iraq is based on a fundamentally and fatally flawed premise: that Iraq can be governed from the center. The last best chance for a stable Iraq is federalism giving the warring factions breathing room in regions with control over the fabric of their daily lives. This resolution calls for the United States to recognize that simple fact and to act on it, said Chairman Joe Biden.\nSen. Boxer said, \"It is far past time for a political solution that recognizes the reality in Iraq- that there is a civil war raging and our troops there are targets. In 1995, with the help of Sen. Biden's leadership, the U.S. devised a plan that allowed Serbs, Croats, and Bosniaks their autonomy with power-sharing. That is a model that makes sense for Iraq today. A continuing military surge is not the answer. We need a diplomatic surge. I am proud to have supported the Biden plan from the beginning.\nThis plan offers the best possible solution to the course that the president has pursued in Iraq a course that is not working because of a lack of understanding of that country by the administration, Sen. Nelson said.\nSpecifically, the resolution calls for the United States to actively support a political settlement among Iraqis based on the provisions of Iraqs constitution that call for creating a federal system of government, with strong regions and a limited central government. And it urges the administration to bring in the international community including the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Iraqs neighbors to support a settlement based on federalism and to convene a conference with Iraqis to help them reach that settlement.\nSenator Biden first championed the idea for a federal system in Iraq over a year ago with Council on Foreign Relations President Emeritus Leslie H. Gelb. Since that time, the idea has sparked much interest and support from political leaders, foreign policy experts and opinion leaders. A sample of such support and interest is included below and a copy of the resolution is attached.\nTHE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE (NIE) ON A FEDERAL SYSTEM IN IRAQ\nThe National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq a consensus report of all U.S. intelligence agencies makes clear the need for a political settlement based on federalism.\nThe NIE identifies developments that could reverse the negative trends driving Iraqs current trajectory, including: broader Sunni acceptance of the current political structure and federalism and significant concessions by Shia and Kurds to create space for Sunni acceptance of federalism.\nThe NIE also warns of the danger of Iraqs civil war becoming a regional war, which underscores the urgent need for a regional diplomatic strategy that involves Iraqs neighbors in supporting a political settlement or containing the violence should reconciliation fail. [U.S. National Intelligence Estimate, 2/2/07]\nFORMER SECRETARIES OF STATE ON A FEDERAL SYSTEM IN IRAQ\nFormer Secretary of State Henry Kissinger: I'm sympathetic to an outcome that permits large regional autonomy. In fact, I think it is very likely that this will emerge out of the conflict that we are now witnessing.\nIf the Iraqis cannot solve the problems that have been described, I've told the Chairman privately, that I thought that this [a federal system in Iraq] was a possible outcome, and at the right moment we should work in the direction that will (inaudible) for maximum stability and for maximum chances of peace. [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/31/07]\nFormer Secretary of State Madeleine Albright: [T]he idea of the constitution of Iraq [as] written, which allows for and mandates, in fact, a great deal of regional autonomy, is appropriate. I think there are certain central powers that a government needs. Some of it has to do with the oil revenue and various other parts. So without endorsing any plan, I do think reality here sets in that there will be regional autonomy.\n[W]hen asked about Senator Biden's plan, I have said that, in fact, it is an attempt to keep the country together, which I do believe is what it is about. I'm just talking about in the long run what might happen that we do have to watch out for. But I think it is very clear from my reading of the plan that it is done in order to keep the country together. And I do think that is an essential point. [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/31/07]\nFormer Secretary of State James Baker: I was and still am interested in the proposal that Senator Biden and Les Gelb put forward with respect to the idea that ultimately you may end up with three autonomous regions in Iraq, because I was worried that there are indications that that might be happening, in fact, on the ground anyway and, if it is, we ought to be prepared to try and manage the situation. So we have a sentence in our report that says, If events were to move irreversibly in this direction, the United States should manage the situation to ameliorate the humanitarian consequences, contain the violence and minimize regional stability. [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/30/07]\nFOREIGN POLICY EXPERTS ON A FEDERAL SYSTEM IN IRAQ\nFormer Iraq Defense Minister Ali Allawi: I think the solution has to be to really face the fact that the invasion, occupation of the country has led to really enormous consequences, not only inside the Iraq but in the region. Unless you administer and control the effects of the invasion, youre unlikely to have much peace. And to do that I think you have to take into account that certain irreversible changes have taken place, especially, for example, the empowerment of the Shiite community, the empowerment of the Kurds, and the effects of that on the various countries of the Middle East.\nJON STEWART: So you see sort of a central government, kind of existing to mediate between Kurds, Shi'a, and Sunni, but then they also have autonomy of their own?\nALLAWI: I think so. In the long term, if you want to have a nation state, these components have to be brought together again. You have to reweave the structures of the country and society. And a central government that is based on a kind of federal arrangement is possibly the best outcome. [The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, 4/18/07]\nAmbassador Dennis Ross, Counseolor and Ziegler Distinguished Fellow, The Washington Institute for Near East Policy: The only thing I would say, though, as I've noted before, with 100,000 Iraqis being displaced a month, you're beginning to create the outlines of that on the ground [a federal system in Iraq]. So I was actually in favor of the idea before, and I think it may have more of a potential now because of that reality. [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/17/07]\nAmbassador Richard Haass, President Council on Foreign Relations: I've long admired the chairman's idea [Of a federal system in Iraq]The problem isit's also put forward by my predecessorthe problem is not the idea. The idea's a reasonable idea; it's a good idea. The problem facing the idea is that it's a reasonable idea that's been introduced into an unreasonable political environment. If Iraqis were willing to sign on to this idea of distribution of political and economic power and so forth, federalism, all Iraqis would be better off and a large part of the problem would fade. The problem is that we can't get Iraqis to sign on to a set of arrangements that, quite honestly, would leave the bulk of them better off. We can't force them to be reasonable. And at the moment, they've essentially embarked on a path which is in some ways self- destructive of a society. So again but the flaw is not inherent in the ideas; it's just, again, we can'tthe very reasonableness that's at the heart of the chairman's idea is rejected again by -- virtually across the board, particularly by Shi'a and Sunnis, because they can't agree on the precise balance, if you will, of political and economic power within their society. So at the moment, there's not yet a federal scheme they would sign on to. [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/17/07]\nMichael O'Hanlon, Senior Fellow, The Brookings Institution: It would be preferableto retain some level of multi-ethnic society... However, let's be clear about what the data showit's happening already. And right now, it's the militias and the death squads that are driving the ethnic cleansing, and the movement towards a breakup of Iraq. And the question pretty soon is going to be whether we try to manage that process, or let the militias alone drive it, because it's happening. 100,000 people a month are being driven from their homes. Iraq looks like Bosnia more and more. [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/10/07]\nYahia Said, Director, Iraq Revenue Watch: I think the constitution, the Iraqi constitution, with all its shortcomings, serves as a good starting point for dialogue. But the constitution needs to be transformed through genuine dialogue from a dysfunctional to a rational federal structure. Oil and negotiations on an oil deal, which have apparently concluded recently, also provide a model for the -- for that rational federalism. The main principles that the negotiators have agreed on is to maximize the benefit of Iraq's oil wells to all Iraqis, to use oil as a way to unite the nation, and to build a framework based on transparency, which is very important in a situation of lack -- of poor trust, and on efficiency and equity. [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/10/07]\nFormer UN Ambassador Richard Holbrooke: \"I urge [President Bush] to lay out realistic goals, redeploy our troops and focus on the search for a political solution. We owe that to the Iraqis who welcomed the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and put their trust in us, only to find their lives in danger as a result. By a political solution, I mean something far more ambitious than current U.S. efforts aimed at improving the position of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki by changing ministers or setting timelines for progress. Sen. Joe Biden and Les Gelb have advocated what they call, in a reference to the negotiations that ended the war in Bosnia in 1995, a \"Dayton-like\" solution to the political situation -- by which they mean a looser federal structure with plenty of autonomy for each of the three main groups, and an agreement on sharing oil revenue.\" [Washington Post, 10/24/06]\nDr. Ted Galen Carpenter, Vice President for Defense and Foreign Policy Studies, CATO Institute: And I believe there is a regional -- there is a reasonable prospect of convincing even Iran and Syria that a proxy war can easily spiral out of control and it would not be in their best interests to tolerate that kind of development, that it is better to quarantine this conflict and allow the dynamics in Iraq to play themselves out. Perhaps at some point the various factions in Iraq will agree on compromise, either a reasonably peaceful, formal partition, or a very loose federation with adequate political compromise. But they have to determine that. We cannot determine that for them. [Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, 1/11/07].\nEric Leaver, Institute for Policy Studies Research Fellow: \"The two alternatives that have been fleshed out most deeply are 'strategic redeployment' and plans for partition... The five-point plan of Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., calling for a virtual partition of Iraq has its roots in proposals made by Peter Galbraith, a former U.S. ambassador with a long involvement in policy on Iraq, and Leslie Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations... Both of these plans have merits... These measures would draw in Iraq's neighbors who are desperately needed for a long-term solution. [TomPaine.com, 9/5/06]\n",

Biden, Jr. (D-DE) sent a letter to President Bush calling for the United States step up the pressure on other countries to provide the essential equipment and vehicles for the Phase Two peacekeeping operation in Darfur. This is essential to expanding future peacekeeping operations.\n\"I write to urge that you help fill an urgent need in Darfur The United Nations approved, and the Sudanese government consented to, \"Phase Two,\" the heavy support package to enable deployment of a full-scale United Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission. I understand that member countries have made commitments to fill most of the 3000 positions, but commitments are lacking for critical equipment, specifically six attack helicopters, as well as armored personnel carriers,\" Chairman Biden wrote. \"The United States has led the world in contributing humanitarian aid for Darfur and has provided valuable assistance, transportation, and in-kind contributions to the African Union forces.

I urge you either to make it a priority to convince other countries to provide the needed helicopters and their crews, as well as other essential equipment and vehicles, or, failing that, to provide this equipment directly.\"\n\"Convincing other nations to equip the Phase Two operation, or doing it ourselves if necessary, would put this desperately needed mission on the ground sooner, and thereby save thousands of lives,\" wrote Chairman Biden.\nThe full text of the letter is attached and included below:\nThe President\nThe White House\nWashington, DC\nDear Mr. President:\nI write to urge that you help fill an urgent need in Darfur. The United Nations approved, and the Sudanese government consented to, \"Phase Two,\" the heavy support package to enable deployment of a full-scale United Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission. I understand that member countries have made commitments to fill most of the 3000 positions, but commitments are lacking for critical equipment, specifically six attack helicopters, as well as armored personnel carriers.\nThe United States has led the world in contributing humanitarian aid for Darfur and has provided valuable assistance, transportation, and in-kind contributions to the African Union forces.

I urge you either to make it a priority to convince other countries to provide the needed helicopters and their crews, as well as other essential equipment and vehicles, or, failing that, to provide this equipment directly.\nToday's press reports that Sudan has reportedly accepted a hybrid mission are encouraging, but it appears that acceptance is conditional and in any case Khartoum has made false assurances in the past. The time for action in Darfur is long overdue; if Sudan does not accept immediate implementation of the peacekeeping mission, we must pursue a comprehensive economic and diplomatic approach to the crisis, including the use of targeted military resources to impose a no-fly zone, support the African Union peacekeepers, and hasten the arrival of the forces for the hybrid UN-AU mission. Convincing other nations to equip the Phase Two operation, or doing it ourselves if necessary, would put this desperately needed mission on the ground sooner, and thereby save thousands of lives.\nSincerely,\nJoseph R.

Biden is the first Democratic candidate for President to receive an endorsement from a state chapter of the AFL-CIO.\nSen. Joe Biden is labors favorite son and he has been loyal to labor his entire career in the United States Senate, said Sam Latham, the President of the Delaware state AFL-CIO. We proudly and unanimously support Senator Biden's nomination for President and appreciate his commitment to Americas working women and men.\nSen. Biden has worked tirelessly on the issues important to Americas working families -- especially in his home state of Delaware, where he has made protecting jobs and promoting the growth of the various manufacturing industries a priority.\nHe has fought to make sure that workers are free to organize and has supported the passage of the Employee Free Choice Act. Sen. Biden co-sponsored the original legislation to establish guidelines to protect the health and safety of American workers on the job. He also supports the Healthy Families Act, which would require employers with 15 or more employees to provide seven paid sick days to care for their own and their families' medical needs, providing millions of Americans with the flexibility they need to both take care of their families and remain working. Sen. Biden has consistently supported an increase in the minimum wage, the rights of workers to receive overtime and the protection of Davis-Bacon wages. Sen. Biden is also in support of a fund to make sure that workers exposed to asbestos get the proper medical care they deserve.\nThe Delaware state AFL-CIO is made up of local representatives from various unions including the Commercial Foodworkers, Transportation Workers, Pipefitters and Plumbers, Bricklayers, Steelworkers, Ironworkers and Musicians unions.\nIn a video released earlier today on youtube, Delaware state AFL-CIO President Sam Latham described Senator Biden's long support for Americas working women and men: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER5DzViyZOw\n",

White, an Iraq war veteran from McComb, Mississippi, will serve as National Coordinator of Veterans for Biden.\nWhite served in the U. S. Marine Corps for six years prior to joining the Army National Guard in 2002 to attend Officer Candidate School. His unit, the 168th Engineering Group, was deployed to Iraq in the spring of 2003 and served there until March 2004. Upon returning home, White was named director of a New York City pilot program designed to assist troops adjust to civilian life when they return from combat. The program, Hope for New Veterans helped secure housing and also focused on those suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.\nI owe it to my brothers and sisters who remain in Iraq to do what I can to give them the best chance to return home safely, said White, who is currently on the campaign trail in Iowa, where he is working to mobilize veterans and their family members for Biden. For me, that means supporting Sen. Biden for President as he is the only candidate from either party to put forward a realistic vision to resolve the Iraq war.\nWhite also pointed out that Sen. Biden was the only Democratic presidential candidate who voted for the Iraq War supplemental bill last month that provided funding for the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles, which will dramatically reduce casualties in Iraq.\nSen. Biden has shown that his foremost concern is for the safety and well-being of those who have placed themselves in harms way, said White.

    "text": "\nGranite State Police and Firefighters Rally Behind Joe Biden\nConcord, NH - Praising him for standing with New Hampshires first responders on the issues affecting the protection and safety of Granite State families, three police and firefighting officials announced they have decided to endorse Joe Biden for President of the United States.\nState Representative and Police Sergeant Mark Preston, Manchester Fire Commissioner and State Representative Robert Haley and Detective Steve Arnold, former President of the New Hampshire Police Association will serve as the backbone of the New Hampshire First Responders for Biden group. As leaders of this group, Detective Arnold and Reps. Haley and Preston will reach out to law enforcement and first responders across the Granite State on behalf of the Biden for President Campaign.\nSergeant Mark Preston of Seabrook is currently serving his first term in the New Hampshire House of Representatives. He has served the Seabrook community for over 26 years and spent two years working with the New Hampshire Attorney-Generals special drug task force in the 1990s. His uncle was 12-term State Senator Bob Preston.\nSenator Biden has stood shoulder to shoulder with first responders throughout his career, said State Representative Mark Preston, a Sergeant and 26 year veteran in the Seabrook Police Force. The 1994 Biden Crime Bill put more officers on the streets and has helped make New Hampshire a safer place to live.\nSenator Joe Biden wrote the 1994 Crime Bill that helped reduce crime across the country by funding the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program. The COPS program had helped New Hampshire law enforcement put an additional 515 police officers on the street and provided $78,584,702 for law enforcement programs as of March of 2006.\nI am very impressed with Senator Biden's work on behalf of our first responders, said Manchester Fire Commissioner and State Representative Robert Haley. Im proud to support Senator Biden because throughout his career, he has shown time and again that public safety, emergency preparedness and the security of our country is his highest priority.\nRepresentative Haley is a six term State Representative who first became involved in New Hampshire Presidential politics in 1976 when he supported Jimmy Carters first Presidential campaign. Most recently Rep. Haley supported Dick Gephardt for President in 2004.\nJoe Biden is the most experienced candidate in the field, Republican or Democratic, said Haley. During the debate he was honest and direct with New Hampshire voters and I respect that. As a Manchester Fire Commissioner, I am especially impressed with Senator Biden's work on behalf of our first responders. It is this, along with his great domestic agenda and foreign policy expertise that makes me certain he will be a great President.\nSenator Biden has been working to give first responders the communications equipment they need to do their jobs safely and effectively in the event of a disaster and he supports the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act that will provide first responders employed by States with collective bargaining rights.\nSteve Arnold served in law enforcement since joining the United States Air Force as a military policeman after high school. When he left the military in 1986 he joined the Portsmouth Police Department and continues to serve the Portsmouth community today as Detective. Detective Arnold is also a former President of the New Hampshire Police Association.\nI decided to personally endorse Joe Biden because he has proven himself to be a true friend of first responders, said Detective Arnold. As an independent, I have looked at all the candidates running for President, Democratic and Republican, and I believe Joe Biden is the leader with the experience and conviction to put the country back on the right track.\nContacts:\nEvan Carlson/ 202-558-8342/ EvanCarlson@JoeBiden.com\nAnnie Tomasini/ 302-428-542\n",

    "text": "\nU.S. Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-DE) and Council on Foreign Relations President Emeritus Leslie H. Gelb first laid out a detailed five-point plan for Iraq on May 1, 2006 in a joint op-ed in the New York Times. While leaving Iraq is necessary, it is not enough we also need a plan for what we leave behind so that we do not trade a dictator for chaos. The Biden-Gelb Plan offers the possibility of a political settlement in Iraq that produces stability, not chaos. It calls for a loosely federated system in Iraq, giving its warring factions breathing room in regions, with control over the fabric of their daily lives, held together by a limited central government. Since that time, Senator Biden has been building bipartisan support for a federal system in Iraq.\nON CAPITOL HILL: Sen. Biden's resolution (S. Con. Res 37) is cosponsored by Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS), Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Senator Gordon Smith (R-OR), Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL) and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX). The Biden resolution specifically calls for the United States and the international community including the UN Security Council and Iraq's neighbors to support an Iraqi political settlement based on federalism. A copy of the resolution is attached.\nIN THE ADMINISTRATION: The Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said on a recent trip to Iraq, \"Perhaps we have gotten too focused on the central government, and not enough on the provinces and on the tribes and what is happening in those\" and the U.S. Ambassador to United Nations Zalmay Khalilzad said he \"favored the idea of U.N. officials helping Iraqis decide, in their current deliberations over their constitution, whether to choose a structure that would transfer power to the regions. 'If they want to go that route [decentralization], it's certainly an option.'\" [Los Angeles Times, 6/25/07]\nToday's news reports indicate that the Biden-Brownback-Boxer resolution is emerging as a leading consensus option for moving forward in Iraq.\nIn Today's Los Angeles Times, Bush Aides Consider Iraq Truce: \"[W]hat proponents of decentralization call a \"federal system of government\" is favored by an unusually broad bipartisan group of senators. They were pulled together this month by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), a presidential candidate, to cosponsor a nonbinding resolution supporting the federalism plan.\nAnd the administration stance may be easing. On a trip to Iraq about a week ago, Gates openly reflected that greater emphasis outside Baghdad might prove more effective. \"Perhaps we have gotten too focused on the central government, and not enough on the provinces and on the tribes and what is happening in those areas,\" Gates told reporters.\nAnd U.N. Ambassador Khalilzad, who was the U.S. ambassador to Iraq until April, has discussed the federalism plan with Biden and Biden's fellow sponsor and presidential hopeful Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.), lawmakers said.\nKhalilzad, in an interview, rejected the idea of imposing decentralization on the Iraqis, saying it could \"backfire politically if it's a 'made-in-Washington' kind of idea.\"\nBut Khalilzad said he favored the idea of U.N. officials helping Iraqis decide, in their current deliberations over their constitution, whether to choose a structure that would transfer power to the regions. \"If they want to go that route, it's certainly an option,\" he said.\nBiden said recently that the federalism plan \"offers the possibility not the guarantee, but the possibility of a soft landing in Iraq.\"\n\"I believe it is the best way to end the war in Iraq in a responsible way,\" he said.\nThe idea is gaining popularity on Capitol Hill.\nJoining Biden is Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), one of the strongest proponents of a deadline for withdrawing most U.S. combat troops. Also cosponsoring the measure are three Republicans, including two conservatives not usually seen as Democrats' allies on the war: Brownback and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas.\nAlthough Hutchison has spoken since last year about creating semiautonomous regions in Iraq, she has generally been one of the administration's most loyal allies on Capitol Hill.\nTo read the full story, please click here: http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-iraqdeal25jun25,1,4...\nIncluded below is a sample of the bipartisan interest and support from political leaders, foreign policy experts and editorial pages from across the country for a federal system in Iraq.\nTHE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE (NIE) ON A FEDERAL SYSTEM IN IRAQ\nThe National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq a consensus report of all U.S. intelligence agencies makes clear the need for a political settlement based on federalism, as called for in the Biden-Gelb plan.\nThe NIE identifies developments that could \"reverse the negative trends driving Iraq's current trajectory,\" including: \"broader Sunni acceptance of the current political structure and federalism\" and \"significant concessions by Shia and Kurds to create space for Sunni acceptance of federalism.\"\nThe NIE also warns of the danger of Iraq's civil war becoming a regional war, which underscores the urgent need for a regional diplomatic strategy that involves Iraq's neighbors in supporting a political settlement or containing the violence should reconciliation fail. [U.S. National Intelligence Estimate, 2/2/07]\nFORMER SECRETARIES OF STATE ON A FEDERAL SYSTEM IN IRAQ\nFormer Secretary of State Henry Kissinger: \"I'm sympathetic to an outcome that permits large regional autonomy. In fact, I think it is very likely that this will emerge out of the conflict that we are now witnessing.\"\n\"If the Iraqis cannot solve the problems that have been described, I've told the Chairman privately, that I thought that this [a federal system in Iraq] was a possible outcome, and at the right moment we should work in the direction that will (inaudible) for maximum stability and for maximum chances of peace.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/31/07]\nFormer Secretary of State Madeleine Albright: \"[T]he idea of the constitution of Iraq [as] written, which allows for and mandates, in fact, a great deal of regional autonomy, is appropriate. I think there are certain central powers that a government needs. Some of it has to do with the oil revenue and various other parts. So without endorsing any plan, I do think reality here sets in that there will be regional autonomy.\"\n\"[W]hen asked about Senator Biden's plan, I have said that, in fact, it is an attempt to keep the country together, which I do believe is what it is about. I'm just talking about in the long run what might happen that we do have to watch out for. But I think it is very clear from my reading of the plan that it is done in order to keep the country together. And I do think that is an essential point.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/31/07]\nFormer Secretary of State James Baker: \"I was and still am interested in the proposal that Senator Biden and Les Gelb put forward with respect to the idea that ultimately you may end up with three autonomous regions in Iraq, because I was worried that there are indications that that might be happening, in fact, on the ground anyway and, if it is, we ought to be prepared to try and manage the situation. So we have a sentence in our report that says, 'If events were to move irreversibly in this direction, the United States should manage the situation to ameliorate the humanitarian consequences, contain the violence and minimize regional stability.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/30/07]\nFOREIGN POLICY EXPERTS ON A FEDERAL SYSTEM IN IRAQ\nFormer Iraq Defense Minister Ali Allawi: \"I think the solution has to be to really face the fact that the invasion, occupation of the country has led to really enormous consequences, not only inside the Iraq but in the region. Unless you administer and control the effects of the invasion, you're unlikely to have much peace. And to do that I think you have to take into account that certain irreversible changes have taken place, especially, for example, the empowerment of the Shiite community, the empowerment of the Kurds, and the effects of that on the various countries of the Middle East.\nJON STEWART: So you see sort of a central government, kind of existing to mediate between Kurds, Shi'a, and Sunni, but then they also have autonomy of their own?\nAllawi: I think so. In the long term, if you want to have a nation state, these components have to be brought together again. You have to reweave the structures of the country and society. And a central government that is based on a kind of federal arrangement is possibly the best outcome.\" [The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, 4/18/07]\nAmbassador Dennis Ross, Counselor and Ziegler Distinguished Fellow, The Washington Institute for Near East Policy: \"The only thing I would say, though, as I've noted before, with 100,000 Iraqis being displaced a month, you're beginning to create the outlines of that on the ground [a federal system in Iraq]. So I was actually in favor of the idea before, and I think it may have more of a potential now because of that reality.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/17/07]\nAmbassador Richard Haass, President Council on Foreign Relations: \"I've long admired the chairman's idea [Of a federal system in Iraq]The problem is it's also put forward by my predecessorthe problem is not the idea. The idea's a reasonable idea; it's a good idea. The problem facing the idea is that it's a reasonable idea that's been introduced into an unreasonable political environment. If Iraqis were willing to sign on to this idea of distribution of political and economic power and so forth, federalism, all Iraqis would be better off and a large part of the problem would fade. The problem is that we can't get Iraqis to sign on to a set of arrangements that, quite honestly, would leave the bulk of them better off. We can't force them to be reasonable. And at the moment, they've essentially embarked on a path which is in some ways self- destructive of a society. So again but the flaw is not inherent in the ideas; it's just, again, we can't the very reasonableness that's at the heart of the chairman's idea is rejected again by -- virtually across the board, particularly by Shi'a and Sunnis, because they can't agree on the precise balance, if you will, of political and economic power within their society. So at the moment, there's not yet a federal scheme they would sign on to.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/17/07]\nMichael O'Hanlon, Senior Fellow, The Brookings Institution: \"I t would be preferableto retain some level of multi-ethnic society... However, let's be clear about what the data show it's happening already. And right now, it's the militias and the death squads that are driving the ethnic cleansing, and the movement towards a breakup of Iraq. And the question pretty soon is going to be whether we try to manage that process, or let the militias alone drive it, because it's happening. 100,000 people a month are being driven from their homes. Iraq looks like Bosnia more and more.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/10/07]\nYahia Said, Director, Iraq Revenue Watch: \" I think the constitution, the Iraqi constitution, with all its shortcomings, serves as a good starting point for dialogue. But the constitution needs to be transformed through genuine dialogue from a dysfunctional to a rational federal structure. Oil and negotiations on an oil deal, which have apparently concluded recently, also provide a model for the -- for that rational federalism. The main principles that the negotiators have agreed on is to maximize the benefit of Iraq's oil wells to all Iraqis, to use oil as a way to unite the nation, and to build a framework based on transparency, which is very important in a situation of lack -- of poor trust, and on efficiency and equity.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/10/07]\nFormer UN Ambassador Richard Holbrooke: \"I urge [President Bush] to lay out realistic goals, redeploy our troops and focus on the search for a political solution. We owe that to the Iraqis who welcomed the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and put their trust in us, only to find their lives in danger as a result. By a political solution, I mean something far more ambitious than current U.S. efforts aimed at improving the position of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki by changing ministers or setting timelines for progress. Sen. Joe Biden and Les Gelb have advocated what they call, in a reference to the negotiations that ended the war in Bosnia in 1995, a \"Dayton-like\" solution to the political situation -- by which they mean a looser federal structure with plenty of autonomy for each of the three main groups, and an agreement on sharing oil revenue.\" [Washington Post, 10/24/06]\nAmbassador Peter W. Galbraith: \"And, Mr. Chairman, if I may say, I am often asked what is the difference between the plan that you and Les Gelb put forward and the plan that I have outlined. And I would say that the central point is what they share is that we believe that the future of Iraq is up to the Iraqis. You and Les Gelb are more optimistic about what that future might bring. And if you're right, I think that would be terrific.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, 1/11/07]\nDr. Ted Galen Carpenter, Vice President for Defense and Foreign Policy Studies, CATO Institute: \"And I believe there is a regional -- there is a reasonable prospect of convincing even Iran and Syria that a proxy war can easily spiral out of control and it would not be in their best interests to tolerate that kind of development, that it is better to quarantine this conflict and allow the dynamics in Iraq to play themselves out. Perhaps at some point the various factions in Iraq will agree on compromise, either a reasonably peaceful, formal partition, or a very loose federation with adequate political compromise. But they have to determine that. We cannot determine that for them.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, 1/11/07].\nWalter Russell Mead, Council on Foreign Relations: \" I thought that the Joe Biden op-ed in the Wall Street Journal yesterday was also a very sober and thoughtful approach.\nJIM LEHRER: For those who didn't read that, capsulize it for us.\nMead: Well, they were basically talking about a way forward in Iraq that would have some bipartisan support, and something that the administration could work with. And I think what we're seeing now is a sense that the country does need to try to move as united as possible.\" [PBS Newshour, 10/25/06]\nAnne Marie Slaughter, Dean of Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University: \"I think that the Biden-Gelb plan is the best option out there.\" [TPMcafe.com, 5/18/06]\nEric Leaver, Institute for Policy Studies Research Fellow: \"The two alternatives that have been fleshed out most deeply are 'strategic redeployment' and plans for partition... The five-point plan of Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., calling for a virtual partition of Iraq has its roots in proposals made by Peter Galbraith, a former U.S. ambassador with a long involvement in policy on Iraq, and Leslie Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations... Both of these plans have merits... These measures would draw in Iraq's neighbors who are desperately needed for a long-term solution. [TomPaine.com, 9/5/06]\nJuan Cole, Middle East scholar and prominent blogger: \"You have to admire Biden for recognizing the mess and for thinking seriously about what structural programs could be implemented to provide a way out of this mess.\" [JuanCole.com, 5/2/06]\nDavid Phillips, Council on Foreign Relations, author of Losing Iraq: \"What they are proposing makes absolute sense. By decentralizing power and giving regions control over governance, economy and cultural affairs, you have some chance of holding the country together.\" [The Guardian, 5/2/06]\nPUBLIC OFFICIALS ON A FEDERAL SYSTEM IN IRAQ\nSenator Barbara Boxer (D-CA): \"Our chairman has come forward with a vision of how this thing can end up in a place where people will stop killing each other, and yet keep together the country of Iraq, to do the things a country has to do, including making sure the oil is shared in a fair way. It's not three separate countries -- he's gotten a rap on that; never was -- always semi-autonomous; policing by your own people; trust built up in that kind of situation. It's just what's happening in Kurdistan.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/31/07]\nSenator Richard Lugar (R-IN): \"My own view is that we have to continually advise our friends in Iraq to get on with this question of the division of the oil money or the dedication of the various groups, as well as how a federation can work.\n\"It may not be an absolute division of the country into three parts, but at least some ways in which the Kurds, who already have a great deal of autonomy, are joined by a lot of Shiites that want the same thing and Sunnis that are worried that they're going to be left out of the picture. And that takes heavy lifting. Politically, a lot of objections even to bringing it up before their congress, but we have to keep insisting that they do. That has to be on the agenda.\" [PBS Newshour with Jim Lehrer, 9/19/2006]\nSenator Sam Brownback (R-KS): \"I think this idea of maybe the three autonomous regions within one country may be the one that we start to move more and more towards.\" [The Hill, 10/24/06]\nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX): \"Allowing the Kurds, Sunni and Shia to govern their own territories while sharing in Iraq's oil revenues through a national revenue stream could help quell the bloodletting.\" [Houston Chronicle, 10/17/06]\nSenator Chuck Schumer (D-NY): \"Mr. Schumer said, he hopes that a controversial plan strongly advocated by Senator Joe Biden of Delawarewhich essentially calls for the dissolution of Iraq into three autonomous ethnic enclaves (and which Mr. Schumer quietly supported last year) will emerge as a concrete Democratic alternative to current administration policy. \"It may actually move into play,\" said Mr. Schumer. \"I've always believed that the Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds hate each other more than they will ever love any central government.\" [New York Observer, 11/20/2006]\nBill Richardson, Governor of New Mexico: \"I would also study Senator Biden's federation [proposal]. I think that may be ultimately the right solution.\" [Christian Science Monitor, 9/27/06]\nMuwaffaq al-Rubaie, National Security Advisor of Iraq: \"I don't think Senator Biden has said that Iraq should be divided into three sections. What I think -- and I can't agree more with Senator Biden and his article, and I think he is a very well-informed person. What we are talking here -- and he's talking about Iraqi constitution. The constitution of Iraq has said very clearly that you can form provinces, regions, federal -- this is a democratic federal system, and any two or three or nine or 10 provinces can get together and form a region, and form a federal unit. And this is exactly what Joseph Biden is saying, or I believe when I read his article I think Biden's idea is a good idea, with some modification because it's very compatible with our permanent constitution, which was ratified on the 15th of October last year.\" [CNN Late Edition, 5/7/06]\nCongressman Chris Van Hollen: \"Democrats have been making some of the most creative proposals. Senator Biden has a proposal for reconciliation in Iraq, but the stay the course rhetoric you hear from this administration clearly isn't getting us anywhere, things are getting worse not better.

I was skeptical at first I thought the Turks would never accept even a semi-independent Kurdistan but events may be heading in the direction of Biden's vision anyway. The Bush administration and its war policies remain committed to the idea of a unitary Iraq no matter what's happening on the ground. Biden's idea of three basically autonomous mini-states ought to get more attention.\" [Washington Post Live Discussion, 6/5/07]\nMichael Hirsh, Newsweek Columnist: \"Joe Biden is dead right on Iraq.[Biden] has been on the record for a year with a fully thought-out vision for Iraq that offers a real alternative to the bleak choice we're getting from everyone else.\" [Newsweek.com, 4/26/07]\nThomas L.

I think Joe Biden has been on top of this from the very beginning. He was on top of the opportunity. He was on top of what stakes we needed or what we needed to do to get some chance of realizing that opportunity and he's been top of saying this isn't working. [CNN The Situation Room, 4/20/2007]\nDavid Brooks, New York Times columnist: \"Senator Biden is the one exception. What happened Friday was significant with this intelligence report. It drove a missile right into the Bush policy. Because what it said was these two people, Sunni and Shia, will never get back together. That destroys the Bush policy. It drove a missile to the Democratic policy because it says we can't get out. So what's the other option? To me it's the soft partition idea that Joe Biden, lone among the leading Democrats, has been in favor of.\" [ABC This Week, 2/4/07]\n\"As Joe Biden points out, the Constitution already goes a long way toward decentralizing power. It gives the provinces the power to have their own security services, to send ambassadors to foreign countries, to join together to form regions. Decentralization is not an American imposition, it's an Iraqi idea. .In short, logic, circumstances and politics are leading inexorably toward soft partition. The Bush administration has been slow to recognize its virtues because it is too dependent on the Green Zone Iraqis. The Iraqis talk about national unity but their behavior suggests they want decentralization. Sooner or later, everybody will settle on this sensible policy, having exhausted all the alternatives.\" [New York Times, Parting Ways In Iraq, 1/28/07]\n\"There is one option that does approach Iraqi reality from the bottom up. That option recognizes that Iraq is broken and that its people are fleeing their homes to survive. It calls for a ''soft partition'' of Iraq in order to bring political institutions into accord with the social facts -- a central government to handle oil revenues and manage the currency, etc., but a country divided into separate sectarian areas to reduce contact and conflict. When the various groups in Bosnia finally separated, it became possible to negotiate a cold (if miserable) peace. Soft partition has been advocated in different ways by Joe Biden and Les Gelb, by Michael O'Hanlon and Edward Joseph, by Pauline Baker at the Fund for Peace, and in a more extreme version, by Peter Galbraith.\" [New York Times, Breaking the Clinch, 1/25/07]\n\"The liberals who favor quick exit never grappled with the consequences of that policy, which the Baker-Hamilton commission terrifyingly described. The centrists who believe in gradual withdrawal never explained why that wouldn't be like pulling a tooth slowly.

Joe Biden (D., Del.). Gutsily, he's put forth a plan for dividing Iraq into semi-autonomous Kurdish, Shiite and Sunni zones, with Baghdad as a federal city; a fair division of oil revenues; and U.S. troops nearby as a watchdog against neighbors' mischief. You can name a dozen ways Biden's approach could collapse. But at least he has put a reality-based proposal on the table. That's more than most of the people seeking your vote right now seem willing to do.\" [Philadelphia Inquirer, 10/1/06]\nDavid Broder, Washington Post columnist: \"At a time when most people see nothing but hopeless discord in Iraq, it is healthy to have someone offering alternatives that could produce progress.\" [Washington Post, 5/4/06]\nJackson Diehl, Washington Post columnist: \"Instead, the time may finally be ripe for some of the ideas that have been doggedly pushed for most of this year by Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden, who has been one of his party's most serious and responsible voices on Iraq... It's easy to find holes in this strategy, as with any other plan for Iraq... But Biden's basic idea -- of an external political intervention backed by an international alliance -- is the one big option the Bush administration hasn't tried.\" [Washington Post, 10/2/06]\nDavid Ignatius, Washington Post columnist: \"The Democrat who has tried hardest to think through these problems is Sen. Joseph Biden. He argues that the current government of national unity isn't succeeding in holding Iraq together, and that America should instead embrace a policy of 'federalism plus' that will devolve power to the Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish regions. Iraqis are already voting for sectarian solutions, Biden argues, and America won't stabilize Iraq unless it aligns its policy with this reality. I disagree with some of the senator's conclusions, but he's asking the right question: How do we fix Iraq?\" [Washington Post, 9/30/06]\nBill O'Reilly, Fox News: \"See, I favor Senator Biden's solution of the three regional areas. Because you've already got one, the Kurds in the north that's autonomous. If you could carve the two out, divide up the oil revenue, have a central government protected by the Americans to make sure that the Iranians don't come in, I think that might work.\" [The O'Reilly Factor, 9/29/06]\nPortland Press Herald (ME) Editorial Board: \"Biden's scenario opens the door for Congress to conduct a needed discussion about options that fall between the status quo and immediate withdrawal.\" [The Portland Press Herald (ME), 5/9/06]\nDelaware News Journal Editorial Board: \"Sen. Joseph Biden has done the country a service by forwarding a thoughtful, realistic plan for the future of Iraq.\" [Delaware News Journal, 5/3/06]\nThe Barre Montpelier Times Argus (VT) editorial board: \"Let's hope someone in the White House reads the Biden-Gelb essay and draws Bush's attention to a solution he can embrace.\" [The Barre Montpelier Times Argus (VT), 5/2/06]\nSt. Louis Post-Dispatch Editorial Board: \"Together with incentives (i.e., a share of oil revenue) to attract the Sunnis, a phased American troop withdrawal and a regional non-aggression pact (Iran and Syria, stay out), the Biden-Gelb plan offers at least a semblance of hope. You could even call it a turning point.\" [St. Louis Post-Dispatch (MO), 05/02/06]\nThe Journal Standard (IL) Editorial Board: \"Sen. Joe Biden [is] among the few Democrats offering something resembling a plan. On Sunday, he floated the idea of separating Iraq along sectarian lines into three largely autonomous states under the umbrella of a weak central government. That may or may not be the ideal policy. The point is we need to do something radically different. The alternative is a mission perpetually unfulfilled and ever more costly in American blood and treasure.\" [The Journal Standard (IL), 5/2/06]\n",

    "text": "\nWashington, DC - U.S. Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) spoke on the Senate Floor today in support of the Employee Free Choice Act (S. 1041), legislation to level the playing field between workers and employers. The legislation specifically allows employees to form unions by signing cards authorizing union representation; establishes stronger penalties for illegal interference with labor organizing; and provides mediation and arbitration for contract disputes.\nWhen the union movement is under attack, the middle class is under attack. When the union movement is strong, the middle class is strong. And when the middle class is strong, our nation is strong, said Senator Biden. By making sure that all you have to do to join a union is no more than what you do to register to vote, we can change the tide in this country so American union movement can grow.\nWhile in 1973, 26 percent of workers in America belonged to unions, today, that number stands at just 12 percent. Since 1973, declining union membership has meant not only a weaker bargaining chip for workers but a significantly smaller paycheck for the American middle class. In fact, 1973 was the last time middle class incomes were able to keep pace with the cost of living.\nThe spending power of a paycheck and the median family income are both actually lower now than they were 35 years ago, said Senator Biden, But productivity is up more than 80 percent. So while were working harder, the average family has not seen the benefits.\nBasic benefits like health care and pensions things unions fought for and won have also been on the decline due to dwindling union membership. Last year, 46 million Americans nationwide and over 100,000 in Delaware went uninsured. And today, only about a third of all Americans can count on a pension plan with a guaranteed payout, compared with approximately nine out of ten a quarter of a century ago. Without access to health care or pensions to cover basic living expenses, Americans and their families are less secure.\nUnion jobs earn 30 percent more than non-union jobs. Union jobs are 62 percent more likely to have employer-provided health care. Union jobs are four times more likely to have a pension. The facts are clear: we need union jobs if we want to make American families more secure, added Sen. Biden.\n",

    "text": "\nWashington, DC - The Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed Chairman Joe Biden's (D-DE) legislation today that would allow the United States to fully pay its dues to UN Peacekeeping missions, and ensure that we do not accrue additional debt through 2008.\n\"At a time when we are seeking a robust UN force in Darfur, and are relying on UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, we should pay our dues in full. Doing so is strongly in our national interest. If the UN didn't conduct these missions, we might have to at a much higher financial cost and burden on our over-stretched military,\" said Sen. Biden.\nSpecifically, Sen. Biden's legislation will allow the United States to fully pay its dues to UN Peacekeeping missions, pay the arrears that we have accumulated, and ensure that we do not accrue additional debt in the coming year. At present, the United States is in arrears in its payments to UN peacekeeping missions in the amount of $117 million due to a \"cap\" that limits payments to UN's peacekeeping budget, which went into effect in January 2006. Currently, the UN assesses the U.S. at about 27 percent of its budget, but the U.S. is prohibited from paying more than 25 percent -- and the amount of arrears grows each month as new bills come in. Sen. Biden's legislation would lift the cap on payments to the UN's peacekeeping budget.\nSen. Biden authored similar legislation last year, and though it passed the Senate as part of the Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Authorization Bill, it was not included in the final version sent to the President.\n\"The United States continues to seek support at the UN for a mission in Darfur. We have voted time and again in the Security Council, and rightfully so, to support critical missions in Lebanon, Haiti, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kosovo, and many others. The UN 'blue helmets' are literally on the front lines in conflicts that are the worst of the worst: protecting civilians, monitoring cease-fires, clearing mine fields, and disarming combatants,\" said Sen. Biden.\n\"Through UN peacekeeping, the U.S. contributes to international peace and stability where we have critical foreign policy interests, while sharing the human, political and financial costs with other nations. We should not shortchange these operations,\" added Biden.\n",

    "text": "\nWashington, DC (July 9, 2007) - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) offered the following comments today in advance of the Senate taking up the FY08 Department of Defense Authorization bill:\n\"Ever since Democrats took back Congress, we've been working to build pressure on the Administration and our Republican colleagues to change course in Iraq. That pressure and the facts on the ground are starting to produce results, as more and more Republicans have stopped backing the President and started looking for ways to work with us to bring our soldiers home and to bring this war to a responsible end.\n\"I've said since last fall, the only way this President will ever change his Iraq policy will be when he looks east down Pennsylvania Avenue and realizes he has lost the support of his own party. We're seeing that happen and I predict we're going to see a lot more of it in the coming weeks. That's how this war will end.\n\"This Defense bill presents us with another major opportunity and a responsibility to change course so that our troops can start to come home. The best way to do that is to get our troops out of the sectarian civil war and to transition them to a much more limited mission of combating Al Qaeda terrorists and training Iraqis. If we do that, the President cannot justify keeping 160,000 boots on the ground in Iraq. We'll be able to start bringing combat forces out in a few months, and to get all those troops not necessary for the limited mission out by next spring. That's exactly what I've been working on day in and day out for six months, from the very first Biden-Hagel-Levin-Snowe resolution opposing the troop surge back in January, to the Biden-Levin provision in the Iraq Supplemental bill setting a target date for withdrawing most of our combat forces. And that's why I will work hard to win support for the Levin amendment to the Defense bill in the coming days.\n\"But I've also been very clear that while starting to get our troops out of Iraq is necessary, it is not sufficient. We also need a plan for what we leave behind so that we do not trade a dictator for chaos and we need a commitment to protect our troops so long as a single one of them remains in Iraq. I will continue to push my plan for a political settlement in Iraq based on federalism - a plan more and more experts and more and more of my colleagues support. And I will continue my fight to protect our troops on the battlefield. Right now, road-side bombs are responsible for 70 percent of casualties in Iraq - they are by far the most lethal weapon used against our troops.\nNew Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles can reduce those casualties by two-thirds. As part of the Defense Authorization Bill, I will introduce an amendment putting the Congress on record - with absolutely no ambiguity - that we will provide every dollar needed to build these life-saving vehicles. As long as we have a single soldier in Iraq, we must do whatever it takes to provide them the best protection possible.\"\n\"I see this week's debate as a real opportunity. The President continues to dig us into a deeper and deeper hole in Iraq. And right now, the most important thing we can do is keep the pressure on him - and our Republican colleagues - to stop digging and to start to work our way out of this war with no end.\"\n",

Joe Biden and Tom Carper are among just 15 senators chosen to resolve differences between the Senate and House versions of the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007.\nSen. Biden was named because he serves as chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and Sen. Carper was named because he serves as a key member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs.\n\"Making our country safer and more secure should be our number one priority - no question about it. It's been almost six years since the September 11 th attacks and we're still nickel-and-diming our security,\" said Sen. Biden. \"Implementing the important recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission is long overdue and this bill will help us take this important step. I'm honored to be, along with Sen. Carper, part of the final negotiations on this critical legislation.\"\n\"I'm pleased to join with Sen. Biden to help bridge differences in important 9-11 Commission recommendations that promote homeland security and reduce terrorist threats,\" Sen. Carper said. \"I will work hard to promptly resolve legislative differences to make sure states with high security risks, such as Delaware, get their fair share of funds to best protect their residents and communities.\"\nThe final legislation will likely include much of what Sens. Biden and Carper promoted in the Senate version (S. 4) to improve rail security, increase homeland security grants to states and localities, improve information sharing among all levels of government, restrict terrorists' entry into the United States and fund a new system so first-time responders to better communicate during a disaster.\nThe Senate version authorized $3.105 billion for each of the next three years for homeland security grants. It increases the government's ability to disrupt terrorist travel and infiltration by strengthening reporting of lost and stolen passports, requiring countries share information about visitors posing threats, and improving counter-terrorism sharing among local, state and federal officials. The legislation sets up a rail and mass transit security system, the first since September 11. It also contains security provisions on aviation cargo and nuclear proliferation.\n",

Biden issued the following statement after press reports that the National Counterterrorism Center has produced a top secret report entitled \"Al Qaeda better positioned to strike the West.\" It apparently finds that Al Qaeda has rebuilt its operating capability to a level not seen since just before September 11, 2001:\n\"This report is a devastating indictment of this Administration's failure to accomplish its most important mission: destroying Al Qaeda and the threat it poses. And it makes a mockery of the Republican refrain that they are much tougher on terrorists than Democrats. President Bush's war in Iraq is denying us the freedom, flexibility and credibility to meet the major threats to our security, starting with radical jihadists like Al Qaeda who use terror as a tool and seek weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\"We must make it our priority to end the war in Iraq and refocus the energy, ingenuity and resources of this country on defeating Al Qaeda once and for all. I've laid out in detail what I would do as President to make America safer. First, I would end the Iraq War and work toward a political solution so that our soldiers are no longer caught in the middle of a civil war. In addition, we need to finish the job in Afghanistan, abandon unilateralism, make it a presidential priority to secure loose weapons in the former Soviet Union and beyond - the most likely source of supply for Al Qaeda - and finally, begin to regain the moral authority needed to lead the world and begin by shutting down Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib. A Biden Administration would make these critical changes immediately, as America cannot afford another day of President Bush's failed policies.\"\n",

    "text": "\n\nBIDEN to Introduce Amendment to Defense Authorization Bill to Put Congress on Record that We Will Provide Every Dollar and Every Authority Needed to Build and Deploy these Life-Saving Vehicles\n\nWashington, DC - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) issued the following statement today following news reports of additional delays in getting Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicles into Iraq. Road-side bombs are responsible for 70 percent of casualties in Iraq - they are by far the most lethal weapon used against our troops. Mine Resistant Vehicles can reduce those casualties by two-thirds. Despite its proven success in protecting our troops, repeated requests from troops on the ground in Iraq for the MRAP were ignored by the Pentagon.\n\"Today's news that our troops in the field pleaded for Mine Resistant Vehicles as far back as 2003 is deeply disturbing. Those on the frontlines knew they needed better protection against the road-side bombs that were killing their comrades; they knew we had the technology - but their requests were repeatedly ignored by the Pentagon and by a President who has claimed all along that he listens first and foremost to those in the field.\n\"I asked Secretary Gates two months ago to investigate the bureaucratic delays in getting Mine Resistant Vehicles into the field- I still have not received a response from him. I asked Secretary Gates then and I ask it again now: 'How is it possible that with our nation at war, with more than 130,000 Americans in danger, with roadside bombs destroying a growing number of lives and limbs, we were so slow to act to protect our troops?' We need to find out now what happened, who's responsible and fix it. This isn't about accountability for the past - it's about saving lives and limbs now.\nBecause it's happening again, with protection against explosively formed penetrators (EFPs) or shaped charges that hit our vehicles from the side. Once again, protection against this threat has been tested, but the military is dragging its feet getting this technology to Iraq.\n\"As part of the Defense Authorization bill this week, I will introduce an amendment making it clear Congress will provide every dollar and every authority needed to build vehicles resistant to roadside bombs and shaped charges. As long as we have a single soldier in Iraq, we must do whatever it takes to provide them the best protection possible. This must be a national priority.\n\"This excuse about 'we didn't expect the war to last this long so we didn't build MRAPS' is outrageous. Before the war started, I urged the President repeatedly to level with the American people about the cost, the risk and the likely duration of this war. Instead, he tried to hide the facts so as not to jeopardize support for the war. Neither the President nor some of the leaders in the Pentagon acted like we were a nation at war. Instead of prioritizing those in danger in the field, they worried about long-term budgets and Secretary Rumsfeld's theories about making the military lighter and more agile. The Pentagon needs to come clean about these repeated delays and guarantee every soldier and their family it will do whatever necessary to protect them every single day they are there.\"\nSen. Biden has been leading the effort to get more Mine Resistant Vehicles on the ground in Iraq as soon as possible. His amendment to the Senate's FY 2007 Supplemental Appropriations Bill (March 28, 2007) accelerated MRAP funding by adding $1.5 billion to the emergency spending bill. As a result, the military can deploy 2,500 more MRAPs six-months sooner than planned. In addition, Sen. Biden has repeatedly called on the Administration to make the construction and deployment of MRAP's and EFP protection a national priority and to investigate the military's failure to field this technology sooner.\n",

The website challenges the other Democratic Presidential Candidates to answer the central question underlying how we end the war in Iraq: 'Then What?'\nSpurred by the debate's groundbreaking format, which will feature 30-second video questions from individuals on the issues that matter to them, the Biden Campaign unveiled a new website, www.joebiden.com/youtube, asking supporters and other YouTube users to upload videos questioning the candidates on their political solution for how to end the war in Iraq without leaving chaos behind.\n\"I have been touring the country for two years - going everywhere from primary states, to red states, and everything in between. The issue that weighs on everyone's mind - no matter where I am - is how we are going to end this war\" said Sen. Biden. \"President Bush will leave the next president with no margin for error in dealing with some of the most critical foreign policy challenges our country has faced in the last fifty years - and ending this war properly is the critical starting point.\"\nPoll after poll shows that Iraq is the most important issue for most Americans (http://www.galluppoll.com/content/?ci'949), yet most of the Democratic presidential candidates ducked an Iraq-only debate in June that was sponsored by the Johns Hopkins University School for Advanced International Studies in Washington, DC.\nSen. Biden's new website features a scripted question for YouTube users to record, in addition to a tutorial video explaining the rationale for the question and the steps behind recording and submitting a video question for the debate.\nThe Question: Every Democrat wants to get our troops out of Iraq as soon as possible. But other than Joe Biden, none of you seem to have a plan for what we leave behind so we don't trade a dictator for chaos and wind up having to send another generation of Americans back to fight in the Middle East. Every Democrat talks about the need for a political settlement in Iraq, but only Joe Biden has a plan for a political settlement. So my question is: then what? Beyond getting our troops out of Iraq, what's your plan to ensure we don't leave a mess behind?\nHow-To Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1x85nJ_Zbg\nThe website also features videos already submitted by YouTube users asking the \"Then What\" question:\nJ.B.

    "text": "\nWashington, DC - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) and Ranking Member Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN) have introduced a bipartisan Senate resolution which calls for the immediate deployment of a peacekeeping mission to Darfur and lays out benchmarks for that mission.\n\"We have a moral obligation here, and it's very simple: stop the genocide in Darfur—now,\" said Senator Biden. \"The U.S. and the international community must deploy a multilateral peacekeeping force as soon as possible. This force must be sufficient in size and equipment and have the mandate - and the means - to protect the people of Darfur. Peace in Darfur requires a global response. The U.S. can and will play a major role, but so must the United Nations and the African Union.\"\nFour years of genocide in Darfur and the surrounding region has left hundreds of thousands of people dead and driven millions more into camps. Last month the Sudanese government agreed, as it has previously, to the deployment of a full-scale, joint peacekeeping operation by the United Nations and the African Union. But in the weeks since then, President al-Bashir has continued his long pattern of backpedaling away from his commitments and at times seemed to recant his promise to allow peacekeeping forces in Darfur.\nThe Biden-Lugar resolution specifically calls for the United States and the international community to raise the forces and contribute the air and ground vehicles and equipment that will be needed to deploy an immediate peacekeeping mission to Darfur. Additionally, the resolution underscores the need for a sustained, high-level diplomatic effort to forge a comprehensive peace settlement. In the event that Khartoum does not abide by its commitments, the resolution calls for the imposition of meaningful measures including multilateral sanctions and a no fly zone. The resolution also makes clear the responsibility of all parties - including the Khartoum government, its militia and rebel groups - to guarantee humanitarian groups access to those in need and security.\nMembers of the United Nations Security Council are currently considering a new resolution authorizing the hybrid peacekeeping mission.\n\"Over the past four years, as many as 400,000 people have died in the 21st century's first genocide. Millions more remain in grave danger, trapped in camps on both sides of the Chadian border. The world stands at a critical moment: we must collectively assume our responsibility to protect the people of Darfur,\" said Senator Biden. \"And if Khartoum does not fulfill its part of the agreement and allow the full deployment of the peacekeeping mission, then the international community must impose multilateral sanctions, an expanded arms embargo, and a no fly zone over Darfur.\"\nThe Biden-Lugar resolution has the following cosponsors: Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS), Hillary Clinton (D-NY), Russ Feingold (D- WI), Tom Harkin (D-IA), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD).\n",

Joe Biden today aimed a direct response, via YouTube video, at New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani's defense of the Bush Administration's failed policies on Iraq and Al Qaeda. The Senator's response can be viewed here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbUhopXfYD0\nIn releasing his video, Senator Biden stated, \"While tomorrow the Democratic candidates debate each other, we should not forget our most important opponents, President Bush and the Republican Presidential candidates, who are surrogates for his failed policies. Mayor Giuliani is becoming this administration's principal apologist.\"\nMayor Giuliani is YouTube's featured candidate and launched his Spotilght video earlier this week. In his response video, Sen. Biden points out that Mayor Giuliani was silent in the face of President Bush losing focus in going after Osama bin Laden and was missing when President Bush cut funding for Sen. Biden's COPS legislation which had added 100,000 police across America.\nThis week in Davenport, Iowa, Senator Biden also introduced his 10-point plan to make America safer by ending the war, focusing on Al Qaeda, engaging in the war of ideas with extremists and funding the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Today marks the third anniversary of the unveiling of the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. President Bush and Republican allies have blocked implementation of these important reforms that are designed to keep our country safe.\nA transcript of Senator Biden's YouTube response to Mayor Giuliani and a copy of Senator Biden's 10-point plan are attached.\nBelow is the transcript of Sen. Biden's YouTube response:\nSEN. BIDEN: This week, the American intelligence community issued a devastating indictment of the policies of the President of the United States, the Vice President, as well as the Republican candidates' positions as they're running for president. It said, quote, \"The terrorism threat to the United States: Al Qaeda is better positioned to strike the West. Al Qaeda has re-generated itself in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\"\nAnd what is the response of Republicans like Rudy Giuliani who touts he's going to make us safer and Democrats can't? He says, quote, \"Depending on which side of the debate you're on, you could find something in this to justify it. The people who are against the President say Al Qaeda has gotten worse.\" Rudy, Al Qaeda has gotten worse. Our intelligence community said it's gotten worse. They are not against the President. They are for the country.\nAnd the idea that you and your colleagues are just figuring out we should focus more on Pakistan, that Al Qaeda is a looming threat...where have you been the last four years? It's the policies of this Administration supported by the candidates running for the Republican nomination for president that have put us in this spot. We should have stayed in Afghanistan and finished the job. We should not be increasing troops in Iraq. We should be dealing with Afghanistan. Al Qaeda and bin Laden are in Pakistan and Afghanistan. And we've done virtually nothing, nothing, to deal with it.\nIn addition to that by the way, what about the 9/11 Commission report, suggesting we had to spend $42 billion to make the country safer? Why hasn't one Republican insisted that it be funded now? And what happened to all the police that Rudy Giuliani talks about making New York City safer? What did he have to say - or any of the other candidates in the Republican Party have to say - when they cut the Biden COPS bill, which put 100,000 cops on the street?\nIt's time to speak some truth to power here. As a Democratic President of the United States, I will better protect this country. We should take no backseat to any Republican malarkey about how they made us safer. Just look at the intelligence committee reports.

    "text": "\n\nLeads National Effort To Speed Production of Mine Resistant Vehicles\n\nCharleston, SC (July 23, 2007) - Today in Charleston, South Carolina, Sen. Joe Biden met with the chief executives of Force Protection Inc. and Protected Vehicles, Inc., two South Carolina-based companies, and held a press conference to provide an update on the production of mine resistant vehicles. Senator Biden has been leading a national effort to get more of these vehicles on the ground in Iraq as soon as possible.\n\"Our government has some fundamental promises to keep to our troops in the field,\" said Sen. Biden. \"When our young men and women make a commitment to serve our country, we owe them the best protective equipment available. These mine resistant vehicles must be deployed immediately.\"\nSenator Biden has been a leader of the effort to get mine resistant vehicles to our troops in Iraq. Roughly seventy percent of all U.S. deaths and casualties in Iraq are caused by road side bombs. Mine resistant vehicles, with their v-shaped hulls, are proven to cut casualties by two-thirds compared to Humvees. This means that almost 1,000 Americans would be alive today and tens of thousands would not be injured had mine resistant vehicles been built and sent to Iraq when commanders in the field first asked for them in 2003 and again in 2005.\nThe military finally decided to order 7,774 mine resistant vehicles early this year, but in March, Sen. Biden discovered that the Bush Administration had failed to ask for sufficient funds to buy these vehicles in its emergency budget for Iraq. Senator Biden succeeded in adding $1.2 billion to the emergency budget. As a result, an additional 2,500 mine resistant vehicles will be sent to Iraq by the end of the year. Since then, commanders in the field have said that they need 15,200 more of these vehicles, but the military is not moving forward on their request. Sen. Biden introduced an amendment in the Senate to the 2008 defense bill to provide up to $24 billion for these additional vehicles.\n",

    "text": "\n\nBiden Program to Start College Financial Aid Process in 8th Grade\n\nWashington, DC - U.S. Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) is championing a pilot education program to start the college financial aid process earlier for students, letting them know as early as 8 th grade that a college education isn't out of reach. Currently, most students find out whether or not they will receive a Pell Grant during their senior year of high school. Sen. Biden is proposing starting the financial aid process earlier - in 8th grade, rather than 12th grade - to allow families and students to plan ahead for college and develop an expectation that the future includes higher education. Sen. Biden's initiative was included in the Higher Education Amendments Act ( S.1762), which passed the Senate today.\n\"Too many kids don't pursue the college track because they think there's no way they can afford it,\" Sen. Biden said. \"We need to let students and their parents know that a college education isn't out of reach - and we need to them know that earlier, rather than later.\"\nMost students find out whether or not they will receive a Pell Grant during their senior year of high school. Currently, about one-third of all public high school students - and nearly half of all African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans - do not graduate from high school. Starting the financial aid process earlier would allow families and students to plan ahead for college and develop an expectation that the future includes graduating high school and going on to higher education. The Biden Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Demonstration Program provides funding for pilot projects in four states, each of which would commit Pell Grants to two groups of up to 10,000 8th grade students; one in school year 2008-2009, and one in school year 2009-2010. Participation would be contingent on students' 8th grade eligibility for free or reduced-price meals under the National School Lunch Program. Local education agencies would be allowed to apply for funding if their National School Lunch Program participation rate was above 50 percent.\n\"An earlier promise of federal aid will begin the conversation about college early and continue it through high school. That way, students and their families can visualize college in their future, and this goal can sustain them through the moment they open their letter of acceptance. This promise can be especially important in changing the expectations of low-income students whose future plans often don't include college,\" said Sen. Biden.\nThe Biden Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Demonstration Program also provides funding for states, in conjunction with the participating local education agencies, to conduct targeted information campaigns beginning in the 8th grade and continuing through students' senior year. These campaigns would inform students and their families of the program and provide information about the cost of a college education, state and federal financial assistance, and the average amount of aid awards. A targeted information campaign, along with a guarantee of a maximum Pell Grant, would provide information essential to the college-planning process and would help break down the barriers that cost and information often form. Additionally, the program requires an independent evaluation to be conducted to determine the impact and effectiveness of the program.\nHighlights of the Biden Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Demonstration Program:\n\nThe Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Demonstration Program Act would commit Pell Grants to two groups of up to 10,000 8 th grade students, one in school year 2008-2009, and one in school year 2009-2010 in four states selected by the Secretary of Education based on submitted applications.\nStudents' participation in the pilot program will be based on their eligibility for the National School Lunch Program.\nTo receive the Pell Grant, participating students must graduate high school and complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).\nStates and the participating local educational agencies will conduct targeted information campaigns starting in the 8 th grade and continuing through the students' senior year. These campaigns will inform students and their families of the program, as well as provide them with information about the cost of college, state and federal financial assistance, and average aid awards.\nThe pilot program requires an independent evaluation to be conducted to determine the impact and effectiveness of the Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Demonstration Program.\n\n",

    "text": "\nWashington, DC — In advance of today's Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing to examine the practice of extraordinary rendition, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) introduced the National Security with Justice Act of 2007. The legislation offers sweeping reforms of United States policies governing the apprehension, detention, treatment and transfer of suspected terrorists. The practice of detaining a suspect in one country and transferring him to another is known as \"rendition.\"\n\"We need to get terrorism suspects off the street so that they're no longer a threat. But that's a short term solution and terrorism is a long term problem,\" said Sen. Joe Biden. \"To solve the long term problem, we need policies that will help us build effective counterterrorism coalitions with foreign governments and diminish recruitment. This is a fight we won't win by ourselves and we won't win by force of arms alone. By bringing rendition within the rule of law, banning torture, and shutting down black site prisons, this legislation does that.\"\nRendition is an effective means of capturing terrorism suspects and gathering valuable intelligence. Despite its effectiveness, however, the United States government's use of rendition has been controversial. Foreign governments have criticized the practice as ungoverned by law. Moreover, they have decried the alleged use of rendition to transfer suspects to countries that torture or mistreat them or to secret, extraterritorial prisons. Our relations with several key foreign governments have eroded as a result, throwing a stumbling block into our efforts to build the effective international coalitions we need to combat terrorism.\nItaly has indicted 26 Americans for their alleged role in a rendition. Germany has issued arrest warrants for 13 United States intelligence officers for their role in another alleged rendition. A Canadian Government commission has censured the United States for rendering a Canadian/Syrian dual citizen to Syria. The Council of Europe and the European Union have each issued reports critical of the U.S. rendition program and European countries' involvement or complicity in it. Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom have each initiated investigations as well.\nThe National Security with Justice Act also closes a hole intentionally left open by the President's recent Executive Order on the CIA's treatment of detainees. The President's Order is notably silent on some of the more controversial techniques the CIA has allegedly used in the past, such as water-boarding, sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, and extremes of heat had cold. Sen. Biden's bill closes this hole by prohibiting all officers and agents of the United States from using techniques of interrogation not authorized by the United States Army Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation.\n\"The United States has always been the pole star by which the world has set its moral compass. The world is looking to us again to develop counterterrorism authorities that comport with human rights and the rule of law. This legislation does that by keeping rendition in our arsenal of counterterrorism weapons, but ensuring that it reflects core American values - protection of basic human rights and respect for the rule of law,\" said Sen. Biden.\nMore specifically, the legislation will:\nProhibit Extraordinary Rendition\nThis legislation creates new safeguards by requiring intelligence services to apply for and obtain an order of rendition - similar to an arrest warrant for national security purposes - from the FISA Court prior to any rendition. The application and order process ensures that rendition is used only if we have solid intelligence indicating that the suspect is a dangerous terrorist. Most importantly, the bill prohibits rendition to countries that torture or mistreat detainees or to secret prisons. The bill includes an emergency exception allowing intelligence services to obtain an order of rendition after taking an individual into custody (but always before that individual is turned over to another country) when special circumstances exist.\nClose Black Sites & Extra-Judicial Prisons\nThis legislation will prohibits U.S. detention of terrorism suspects in secret, extraterritorial prisons such as CIA \"black sites.\" Under this legislation, the United States must timely transfer terrorism suspects to legal custody in the United States or a foreign country that will not torture or mistreat them.\nProhibit the Torture or Mistreatment of Detainees in U.S. Custody\nThis legislation closes gaps intentionally left in the President's July 20, 2007 Executive Order to allow the CIA to use interrogation techniques prohibited by the Army Field Manual. The legislation prohibits all U.S. personnel, including the CIA, from using interrogation techniques not authorized in the Field Manual.\nModify the Definition of \"Unlawful Enemy Combatant\"\nThis legislation changes the Military Commission Act's definition of the term to clarify that U.S. citizens or lawfully admitted aliens taken into custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States cannot be considered unlawful enemy combatants. These individuals must be prosecuted within the criminal justice system.\nExtend Habeas Corpus to Detainees\nThis legislation repeals the provisions in the Detainee Treatment Act and Military Commission Act that purport to deprive Guantanamo detainees of the writ of habeas corpus - the ability to argue to a court of law that they are being held in error. The legislation clarifies that all detained terrorism suspects held by the United States can invoke habeas corpus to challenge their classification as an unlawful enemy combatant and their conviction by a military commission of a war crime.\n",

    "text": "\nWilmington, DE (August 1st, 2007 ) - The Biden for President Campaign today congratulated Sen. Barack Obama for arriving at a number of Sen. Biden's long-held views on combating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Much of what Senator Obama has proposed Senator Biden has already initiated or accomplished.\nSenator Biden was the co-author of the Afghanistan Freedom and Support Act of 2002 that authorized the original reconstruction and security assistance for Afghanistan. Since 2005, he has repeatedly called for significantly increasing reconstruction assistance. He is the lead co-author with Senator Hagel of the new Afghan Freedom and Support Act of 2007 which will be introduced in September and will authorize significantly increased reconstruction assistance for Afghanistan.\nAs part of the 9/11 bill that passed Congress last week, Senator Biden and Representative Lantos wrote the law that conditions aid to Pakistan on its cooperation with the United States in combating Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Before writing the law, Biden wrote to President Musharraf and Secretary Rice making clear his intent to do so.\nStarting in January, Senator Biden has repeatedly called for surging more forces out of Iraq and into Afghanistan.\nAt a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on January 30th, 2007, Sen. Biden discussed the need for a surge in Afghanistan at Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing.\nSen. Biden said to Ambassador John Negroponte, \"And if we're going to surge anywhere, Mr. Ambassador, you will probably hear from some on the committee beyond me, but you'll clearly hear on the Senate floor, we think that surge should be Afghanistan, not Iraq, where the Taliban appears to be making a serious comeback. So there may be some questions about Afghanistan, as well.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/30/07]\nAt this same hearing, Sen. Obama asked two questions - he did not address Afghanistan or Al Qaeda or Taliban. T he first was on the topic of Iran; the second was on an issue that he admitted \"seems somewhat parochial, but I think, as you'll see, is of concern across the world.\" Obama discussed the \"stunning level of mercury in fish\" and asked about a proposal for the U.S. adopt a ban on mercury sales abroad? [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/30/07]\nSimilarly on March 8th, Sen. Biden convened a hearing on a new strategy for Afghanistan: Repeated Call for Troop Surge to Eradicate Taliban. In his opening statement Sen. Biden said, \"Success in Afghanistan is still possible ... if we surge forces anywhere, it should be in Afghanistan, not Iraq.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Press Release, http://www.senate.gov/~foreign/testimony/2007/BidenStatement070308.pdf, 3/8/07]\nAt this hearing, Sen. Obama asked one question that was unrelated to Taliban or Afghanistan. Addressing Retired General James Jones Jr., Obama asked, \"General, thanks for the very useful testimony. I want to focus on where both of you ended up, and Ambassador Dobbins, as well, and that's on the issue of Pakistan. Given your history there, your relationship with both the Pakistani military on the ground, as well as their government, can you give me a sense of what their strategic objectives are, and what we can do to encourage them to be more aggressive or more cooperative in the efforts? I tend to agree with the ambassador's point that, if we pretend that we're going to do things here that we're not going to do, that's not particularly effective, and that sanctions may not be particularly effective. On the other hand, we need to encourage a different approach on their part. Any thoughts on that?\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 3/8/07]\nSen. Biden has been talking about this for over 6 months. Dating back to January 5th, Sen. Biden said America Should Surge Troops in Afghanistan. He told the Washington Post, \"If we're surging troops anywhere, it should be in Afghanistan,\" Biden said. Adding troops there would give the United States \"the moral high ground\" in its quest for more forces from NATO allies. [Washington Post, 1/5/07]\n\"We find it a little disingenuous that Sen. Obama is hailing this as a new bold initiative when he has neglected to join his colleagues in the Senate when the opportunities have been there to redirect our forces into Afghanistan\" said Biden for President Campaign Manager Luis Navarro. \"It's good to see Sen. Obama has finally arrived at the right position, but this can hardly be considered bold leadership.\"\n",

Additionally, the resolution underscores the need for a sustained, high-level diplomatic effort to forge a comprehensive peace settlement. In the event that Khartoum does not abide by its commitments, the resolution calls for the imposition of meaningful measures including multilateral sanctions and a no-fly zone. The resolution also makes clear the responsibility of all parties - including the Khartoum government, its militia and rebel groups - to guarantee humanitarian groups security and unhindered access to those in need.\n\"We have a moral obligation here, and it's very simple: stop the genocide in Darfur—now,\" said Senator Biden. \"Peace in Darfur requires a global response. The U.S. Senate and the U.N. have resolved to act; now we must turn that resolve into reality by getting commitments for the necessary troops and equipment and aggressively pursuing the peace process itself.\"\n\"I commend the United Nations for acting on Darfur yesterday by authorizing 26,000 peacekeeping troops. Also yesterday, the Senate approved Resolution 276, which asks the Bush Administration to urgently request the necessary funding to cover our portion of the costs of this vital mission,\" U.S. Sen. Dick Lugar said. \"We strongly urge our government, as well as others, to act swiftly and robustly.\"\nEarlier in the day yesterday, the United Nations Security Council announced its decision to authorize the deployment of a multilateral peacekeeping force to Darfur.\n\"The United Nations Security Council took a significant step forward yesterday by authorizing the deployment of over 26,000 peacekeepers to Darfur,\" said Senator Biden. \"The nations of the world must take the next step by providing the necessary personnel and the equipment to get troops on the ground as soon as possible. I know that some of the original language in this U.N. resolution was omitted in order to achieve consensus: we must have an equally strong consensus that if Khartoum obstructs the deployment of this mission, then the international community stands ready to impose multilateral sanctions, an expanded arms embargo, and a no-fly zone over Darfur.\"\n",

    "text": "\n\nCommits to Fight for America's Workers as President\n\nChicago, IL (August 7, 2007) - During this evening's AFL-CIO Presidential Forum at Soldier Field in Chicago, Sen. Joe Biden stood head-and-shoulders above the rest of the field, pointing to his long record of working for labor's interests and reiterating his commitment to reinvigorate the union movement that built the middle class in America.\nDuring the 90-minute forum, Sen. Biden pledged that starting on Day One as President of the United States, he will end the war the Bush Administration has waged on labor.\n\"The war in Iraq is not the only war this President has waged\" said Sen. Biden. \"He has waged a reckless war on labor's house - the house that built the middle-class and the house that built our neighborhoods.\"\nSen. Biden has been leading the fight for organized labor his entire career -- including serving as co-sponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act, fighting for better labor and environmental standards in trade agreements and opposing new trade agreements that don't meet high standards, just to name a few. See the attached document to view Sen. Biden's Record on Labor.\n\"This upcoming election could very well be the most important election in the history of organized labor since 1932. This could be the year when a friend of organized labor takes back the White House and the White House begins to speak again for the middle class\" said Biden for President Campaign Manager Luis Navarro. \"We need a Democrat who can win a general election and deliver results when he or she gets there - and that Democrat is Joe Biden.\"\nJoe Biden: Fighting for America's Workers\n\"Every day we see more evidence this economy is not working for middle-class Americans.\nIf we honor work, we have to reward it.\"\n-- Joe Biden\n\nJoe Biden's Plan to Keep America Working:\nProtect Worker Rights to Organize: As president, Joe Biden will put a stop to George Bush's war on labor. Joe Biden is a co-sponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act, and he will always work to ensure workers have the right to join unions without interference from employers.\nDefend Workers in Trade Negotiations: Joe Biden believes that US trade negotiations must protect American workers by insisting on basic labor and environmental standards. That's why he opposed CAFTA and fast track authority for President Bush. He will continue to fight for better labor and environmental standards in trade agreements and will oppose new trade agreements that don't meet high standards.\nProtect Retirement: Joe Biden believes that after a lifetime of work, the last thing people should worry about is their retirement being in jeopardy.\n\nJoe Biden has fought against dangerous plans to privatize Social Security that would slash benefits for future retirees. He also supports making it easier for workers to save for retirement.\n\n\nJoe Biden has worked to prevent another Enron by authoring new criminal penalties for corporate fraud that robs workers of investments.\n\n\nJoe Biden is working to protect workers from pension bankruptcy by strengthening the government backstop and insisting that pensions are adequately funded.\n\nCreate Green Collar Jobs: As president, Joe Biden will work to create the new jobs that come with a new world. Green-collar jobs will make homes and businesses more energy efficient. Joe Biden has been a leader in the senate, co-sponsoring a worker training program that could help create 3 million new jobs as the U.S. builds a new energy future.\nMeet the Demand For New Health Care Workers: Americans are living longer, healthier lives. That's creating a growing challenge to provide adequate care for all. Estimates indicate we will need to hire more than 100,000 new nurses in the next decade. We will needs thousands of health care workers and aides. Joe Biden believes we can meet that need by investing in more training and attracting people to the profession. He will expand funding for nursing students through increased funding for loan repayment and scholarship programs. Joe Biden also supports retraining laid-off workers as nurses or in other heath care fields.\nIncreasing the Minimum Wage: The minimum wage has been stagnant for too long in this country, no one should work a full time job and be too poor to meet their basic needs. Joe Biden supported raising the minimum wage to $7.25 from $5.15 —where it had been stuck for 10 years. As president, Joe Biden will continue to fight hard for better pay for all working Americans, beginning with the minimum wage.\nFocusing on Workplace Safety: Joe Biden believes that all employees should be covered by regulations that ensure a safe working environment and their personal safety on the job. He has been a supporter of OSHA regulations since his early days in the Senate and time and time again he has voted to extend OSHA regulations and have vigorously opposed efforts to restrict the application of OSHA coverage.\nDefending Overtime: Joe Biden has fought attempts to undermine overtime rights and reduce provide overtime to teachers, nurses, and salespeople.\nProtecting Wages for Katrina Workers: Joe Biden fought against the Bush Administration's attack on workers and helped save Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements for the rebuilding of the gulf coast region destroyed by Hurricane Katrina.\nSupporting Workers Whose Jobs Have Moved Overseas: Joe Biden has been a strong supporter of Trade Adjustment Programs. He opposes taking resources from the trade adjustment assistance program and believes that we need to make the assistance more substantive for those who qualify. Joe Biden believes we should ensure that all workers who are displaced by technological and economic change have access to resources and opportunities.\nHelping Working Families: Joe Biden understands the difficulties of balancing work and family. He supports the Family and Medical Leave Act and knows how important it was to help the 50 million Americans who have taken advantage of up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for sick family members. We can do more though, and that's why Joe Biden is cosponsoring the Healthy Families Act—a bill that would make it mandatory for employers of 15 or more workers to provide seven days paid leave for their own or their families' health care, providing millions of Americans with the flexibility they need to both take care of their families and remain working.\nCaring for Seniors: Joe Biden knows from caring for his own parents how important home care workforces can be in providing stable, experienced care to the growing number of senior citizens who wish to stay in their homes. Joe Biden supports expanding access to home healthcare and hospice services and co-sponsored the Community Choices Act, which would help disabled Americans get Medicaid coverage for at-home care.\n",

Faircloth used that in a TV ad, saying Edwards promised to be \"a warrior\" for labor. In fact, Edwards said he would be a warrior for labor unions only on those issues on which they agreed. One of those issues is right-to-work laws, which prevent workers from being forced to join a union. Unions oppose such laws.

That law, which the AFL-CIO opposes, means no one can be forced to join a union or pay dues. Edwards says he supports North Carolina's law. But he opposes a national right-to-work law backed by Republican Faircloth. 'I don't think the federal government needs to get involved with it,' Edwards said. That was good enough for James Andrews, the AFL-CIO's executive director, who has virtually given up on finding a viable candidate who will fight North Carolina's right-to-work law. 'We understand that the Jim Hunts of the world and John Edwards of the world . . . are certainly not going to oppose the current law,' Andrews said. 'Politically, I don't expect to have anyone leading the charge to change that. We understand and accept that. Edwards is not going to be 100 percent with us on all our issues, but he certainly has expressed commitment and understanding of working families.'\" [Charlotte Observer, 10/7/98, emphasis added]\n\n",

Barack Obama's support of the Biden-Gelb Plan for Iraq.\nAt a town hall meeting in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Sen. Obama said, \"The idea of a partition, of some sort, in Iraq, some sort of federal system that gave the Sunni, the Shia, the Kurds their own autonomy in their regions, is something that's been talked about….I had a long conversation with Les Gelb, who used to be the head of the Council on Foreign Relations, and who advised Biden on this plan. I think it may end up being the best solution [Obama Town Hall Meeting, Cedar Rapids, IA, 7/30/07.]\nTo view the video of Sen. Obama's statement of support for the Biden-Gelb Plan for Iraq go to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ7dSVyP1p4\nFor well over one year, Sen. Biden has argued that the only way to maintain a unified Iraq is to decentralize it, thereby giving the Kurds, Shiites and Sunnis local control over their daily lives - as provided for in the Iraqi Constitution. Specifically, Section 112 of the Constitution states, \"The federal system in the Republic of Iraq is made up of a decentralized capital, regions and governorates, and local administrations\" The Constitution gives significant powers to the regions and limits the authority of the central government to truly common concerns like border security and the distribution of oil revenues.\n\"There is not a single person out there, including all of my democratic opponents, who want our troops to spend another day - another minute - in Iraq. And we're getting out one way or the other. But what do we do when we leave and how we leave makes a big difference. It is going to matter and I have a political plan that gives us a way to leave without leaving chaos behind\" said Sen. Biden. \"There is absolutely no chance - zero - that the Iraqi people will support a strong central government. It is time for the Democratic Party to unite and get behind the Biden-Gelb plan. And it is time for all of my colleagues to join with myself and Sens. Boxer, Brownback and Nelson in supporting our legislation which would make this plan the policy of our government.\"\n\"Sen. Clinton and others continue to cling to the idea that Iraq can come together behind a strong central government. This is just mistaken.\", said Sen. Biden. \"The Bush Administration has pushed this idea for years and we continue to see this does not work and will only lead to continuing civil war and increasing danger in unstable world. (http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=2354 ) We must answer the question of what happens after we leave Iraq, and in my view, the only real solution is a loosely federated regional system, as called for in the Iraqi constitution. We need to debate this issue of what comes next in Iraq - and we need to do that now.\"\nSen. Biden also today launched a new series of videos on his website www.headtohead08.com which show some of the latest videos on this topic, including Sens. Clinton, Obama and Governor Richardson.\n",

Joe Biden once again displayed presidential leadership and showed clearly why he is the best candidate to lead the country out of Iraq without leaving chaos behind.\n\"Joe Biden continues to show that he is the only candidate who has the right experience among the field and a true understanding of all the critical issues, especially Pakistan and Iraq, necessary to lead this country into what is bound to be an incredibly difficult decade,\" said Biden for President Campaign Manager Luis Navarro. \"He is the truth-teller about the war in Iraq and he will continue to focus his efforts on bringing our troops safely without leaving chaos behind. This morning we saw many on the stage utter the words 'Joe is right' in one form or another.\"\nThis morning, the Biden Campaign also launched its first television ads, a 30-second ad entitled \"Cathedral\", which debuted during the debate on ABC and a 60-second ad, entitled \"Security\", which will begin airing today on all major networks in Iowa.\nIn \"Cathedral\", Sen. Biden recounts a story from one of his seven trips to Iraq, during which he found himself on a C-130 transport plane with a flag-draped coffin. Sen. Biden describes the sacred commitment he felt to our troops during that moment. That moment manifested itself in Sen. Biden's successful effort in Congress earlier this year to secure funding for new mine resistant vehicles for our troops in Iraq.\nIn \"Security\", Sen. Biden lays out the case for why his leadership qualities and life experiences prepare him to be Commander-In-Chief and President of the United States. The current campaign is scheduled to run through Labor Day weekend at a cost of approximately a quarter of a million dollars.\nTo view the ads, please go to www.joebiden.com\n",

Biden, Jr. (D-DE) issued the following statement today after the Pentagon announced that only 1,500 - rather than the planned 3,500 - Mine Resistant Vehicles would be delivered to Iraq by year's end:\n\"This is outrageous and another example of this Administration's gross mismanagement of this war. We know that 70 percent of casualties in Iraq come from road-side bombs and these Mine Resistant Vehicles can reduce those casualties by two-thirds - so getting MRAPS into the field needs to be a national priority. Instead of being told about delays, I want to hear how we're going to do better. This nation knows how to make steel and trucks and the American people will do what it takes to get our troops the equipment they need, but the President needs to make it his top priority. Our troops are being killed and these vehicles save lives. No more delays; no more excuses.\"\nSen. Biden has been leading the effort to get more Mine Resistant Vehicles on the ground in Iraq as soon as possible. His amendment to the Senate's FY 2007 Supplemental Appropriations Bill (March 28, 2007) accelerated MRAP funding by adding $1.5 billion to the emergency spending bill. In addition, Sen. Biden has repeatedly called on the Administration to make the construction and deployment of MRAP's and EFP protection a national priority and to investigate the military's failure to field this technology sooner. He has also introduced an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill to put Congress on record that we will provide every dollar and every authority needed to build and deploy these life-saving Mine Resistant Vehicles.\n",

    "text": "\nWilmington, DE (August 23, 2007) - Sen. Joe Biden today issued the following statement on how to end the war in Iraq:\n\"This war must end but it matters profoundly how we end it. As we leave, we must do everything we can not to leave behind chaos that undermines American security for a generation. That requires a lasting political settlement. Unfortunately, like President Bush, some of my Democratic colleagues are clinging to a fatally flawed premise that Iraq can be governed from the center by a strong national government that secures the support of the Iraqi people. President Bush is surging forces to buy more time for the central government to succeed. It cannot. Some of my colleagues, like Sen. Clinton, believe that replacing Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Al-Maliki and pressuring the central government will force it to get its act together. They, too, are wrong. Maliki is a problem, but this fixation on a strong central government is the problem with our policy. There is no trust within the central government, no trust of the government by the people, no capacity by the Iraqi government to deliver security or services and no prospect it will build that trust and capacity any time soon. Replacing Maliki won't change that fact. Absent an occupation we cannot sustain or a dictator we cannot want, Iraq will not be governed from the center.\nSome of my other democratic colleagues, including Senators Obama and Dodd and Governor Richardson, seem to be coming around to that reality. Each has spoken in positive terms about my plan to end the war in Iraq by separating the warring factions and helping Iraqis build a decentralized, federal system that gives its major groups control over the fabric of their daily lives, as we did in Bosnia. But they say they are reluctant to \"impose\" a political settlement on the Iraqis. In fact, my plan \"imposes\" nothing on the Iraqis; rather, it would implement what is already in their constitution and laws. The Iraqi constitution establishes a decentralized, federal system in Iraq, with extensive powers for the regions and limited powers for the central government. The Iraqi parliament passed legislation, which takes effect early next year, to implement those provisions of the constitution. If my opponents would read the constitution and Iraq's laws, their concern about fully backing my plan would vanish. I call on them to do so, and to support the Biden-Boxer-Brownback legislation, which would force the Bush Administration to change policy and support the Iraqi Constitution.\n",

    "text": "\nWilmington, DE (September 3, 2007) - Sen. Joe Biden today released the following statement in response to President Bush's trip to Iraq:\n\"Today we learned that President Bush has gone to Iraq to survey the situation on the ground first hand. This is good news. The President needs to see what the rest of us have seen and know. While his plan for a surge in Iraq has had limited and temporary military success, it has not brought about the kind of political reconciliation the President and his Cabinet had hoped for.\nIt is my sincere hope that the President is going to Iraq, not with an outcome in mind, but with his eyes open looking to learn the facts on the ground. And the facts are: there is no chance that Iraq can be governed by a strong central government no matter how many troops we have there.\nWe'll be hearing a lot about the \"surge\" over the next several weeks, but we all must remember its original purpose: to buy time for the central government in Iraq to get its act together and win the trust of all Iraqis.\nThat will not happen.\nAbsent an occupation which we cannot sustain or the return of a dictator which we cannot support, Iraq cannot be governed from the center at this point in its history.\nThere is no trust within the government, no trust of the government by the people, no capacity by the government to deliver security and services, and no prospect it will build that trust and capacity any time soon.\nI've been making that case for over a year. And so have more and more experts, in and out of government.\nBack in November, CIA director Michael Hayden made this very point in a private meeting with the Iraq Study Group.\nHe said \"the inability of the [central] government to govern is irreversible.\" There is no \"milestone or checkpoint where we can turn this thing around,\" he said. \"We have spent a lot of energy and treasure creating a government... that cannot function.\"\nTwo weeks ago, our entire intelligence community came to the same conclusion. The National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq found that \"Iraqi political leaders remain unable to govern effectively\" and predicted that \"the Iraqi government will become more precarious over the next six to twelve months.\"\nAs everyone knows, I have offered a plan that contains the possibility, not the guarantee, of promoting stability in Iraq as we leave. It's based on the reality that Iraq cannot be governed from the center.\nInstead, we have to give its warring factions breathing room in their own regions, with control over the fabric of their daily lives - police, education, jobs, marriage, and religion.\nA limited central government would be in charge of truly common concerns, including protecting Iraq's borders and distributing oil revenues.\nThe good news is: the federal system at the heart of my plan is already in Iraq's constitution and in its laws.\nWe should refocus our efforts on making federalism work for all Iraqis. It is past time to make Iraq's the world's problem, not just our own.\"\n",

We also celebrate the labor movement which has fought to ensure fair treatment for these workers so integral to our economy and society.\n\"For more than three decades, I have stood by America's working men and women.

If we honor work, we have to reward it.

    "text": "\nWilmington, DE (September 13, 2007): Today during a campaign swing through western Iowa and Nebraska, Sen. Joe Biden made the following remarks in advance of President Bush's address tonight on the war in Iraq.\n(As Prepared For Delivery)\nTonight, President Bush will give the American people a progress report on the war in Iraq.\nThis war belongs to the President, not to his generals or his ambassadors.\nIt is the President's time - and his responsibility - to answer a question that the general carrying out his policies in Iraq could not answer: is pressing ahead with the war making America safer?\nBased on everything we heard this week from the President's surrogates and everything I have seen and heard during my eight trips to Iraq, the answer is no.\nThe President's strategy in Iraq is not succeeding. It is not making America safer. Doing more of the same would be a disaster.\nThe President's strategy is to stand up Iraq security forces so that we can stand down.\nBut four years and $20 billion later, the Iraqi army is still years away from being ready to take over. The Iraqi national police force is so corrupt and so sectarian that one of our most respected military leaders, General Jim Jones, recommended that it be disbanded.\nThe President's strategy is to build a united, democratic central government in Baghdad that secures the support of all Iraqis. The primary purpose of the President's surge was to buy time for that central government to succeed.\nBut eight months into the surge, there has been no political progress in Baghdad. The sectarian war continues unabated… militias still dominate the country… and more Iraqis are fleeing their homes for fear of sectarian violence than ever before.\nDespite these failures, President Bush is about to tell the American people that: He will continue the surge for another six months, putting more American lives and limbs at risk for no strategic gain.\nWhen the surge finally ends next year, we will be right back where we started: with 130,000 Americans in Iraq, no lasting change on the ground and no end in sight.\nThat is unconscionable.\nPressing ahead with this war, in this way, will not make America safer. The President does not recognize that reality. I do - and I know what we should do about it.\nWe need and I have proposed a comprehensive strategy to end the war in Iraq while protecting our troops and not leaving chaos behind.\nFirst, instead of continuing the war with no end in sight, we have to start to bring our troops home now, and withdraw most of them next year.\nI would limit the mission of those that remain to fighting al Qaeda, training Iraqis and helping them protect their borders.\nSecond, so long as we have any troops left in Iraq, we must treat them with care, not disdain, and give them the best protection this country can provide.\nIf a soldier spends a year in Iraq, he should get at least a year at home before we send him back.\nAnd if a soldier spends a single day in Iraq, he should be able to ride in the Mine Resistant vehicles I've been fighting so hard to build -- vehicles that can cut by 70 percent casualties and deaths from roadside bombs.\nThird, while leaving Iraq is necessary, it is not enough. We need a plan for what we leave behind so that we do not trade a dictator for chaos in Iraq and the region that endangers America's interests for a generation.\nI have a plan that offers the possibility, not the guarantee, of stability in Iraq as we leave. It's based on the reality that Iraq cannot be governed from the center, as this President believes, because Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds are not ready to entrust their fates to each other.\nInstead, we have to give Iraq's warring factions breathing room in regions, with local control over the fabric of their daily lives - police, education, jobs, marriage, religion - as Iraq's constitution provides. A limited central government would be in charge of common concerns, including distributing Iraq's oil revenues.\nA federal, decentralized Iraq is our last, best hope for a stable Iraq. More and more people, inside Iraq and out, are coming to that realization.\nWe should refocus our efforts on making federalism work for all Iraqis. I would initiate a diplomatic surge to do just that, bringing in the U.N., major countries and Iraq's neighbors to help implement and oversee the political settlement I'm proposing.\nIt is time to turn the corner.\nStop the surge and start bringing our troops home.\nEnd a political strategy that cannot succeed and begin one that can.\nAnd always, always protect our troops.\nThis is President Bush's war. But it is America's future. We have to get this right, together.\n",

Rep. McCarthy was joined by two of his colleagues, Reps. Doris Kelley (D-Waterloo) and Assistant Majority Leader John Whitaker (D-Hillsboro), both of whom endorsed Sen.

President Bush has no intention of ending this war in Iraq on his watch,\" said Biden. \"The truth is President Bush wants to leave at least 100,000 troops in Iraq when he leaves office. It will be left to the next president to end this war without leaving chaos behind and I am the one candidate in either party that has a comprehensive solution for ending this war. And the truth is -- this war must end.\"\nBiden continued, \"Too many people are saying we don't want to impose a political settlement on Iraq, but the fact is that a federal system, where the tribes and religious leaders can form their own states, is called for in their constitution. What they need is our help in bringing the international community and the neighboring states to the table to enforce their own laws. They can't do it themselves and our soldiers can't enforce them either.\"\nBiden added, \"We must get our soldiers out of this civil war where they become justification for the Bush-fulfilling prophecy of Al-Qaeda in Iraq to flourish. We must legislate a new mission for our troops to secure the borders and focus on Al-Qaeda. That is the only way, short of a sea change among Republicans in Congress, to force the President to draw down troops this year.\"\n\"Most importantly,\" added Biden, \"by pulling our troops out of Iraq we will be strengthening the U.S. military by allowing them to resume normal rotations and we will have the flexibility to focus on the real Al-Qaeda threat to the U.S. which is fomenting along the Afghan-Pakistan border where Osama bin Laden is still in hiding.\"\n\"It is only by adopting my comprehensive plan that we can truly reduce the threat to our country and end this war in a way that keeps our troops safe in the process and stops the war from metastasizing through the region,\" Biden concluded.\n",

    "text": "\n\nKeeping Our Promise To America's Seniors\n\nWilmington, DE (September 19, 2007) - Today, Sen. Joe Biden unveiled his plan to help families save and prepare for a secure retirement. After seven years of stagnant wage growth under the Bush administration, American families are finding it harder than ever to save and prepare for retirement.\nIn the 1980's, 83 percent of private sector workers were covered by pension plans - these hard-working Americans could count on predictable payments for the rest of their lives. Today, just 20 percent of private-sector employees have a pension and these pensions are not as secure. When a corporation reorganizes under Chapter 11, too often executives take care of themselves first, while they turn their backs on obligations to workers.\nTo keep our promise to seniors, Sen. Biden is proposing to crack down on executives who get bonuses while companies walk away from employee pensions, require employers that don't provide retirement plans to allow employees to make direct deductions into Individual Retirement Accounts and make it easier to take retirement plans with you by automatically rolling over 401 (k) plans. To begin the process of saving earlier in one's life, as President, Sen. Biden would invest $500 in a Kid's Account for every American child born after December 31, 2008. He is also reaffirming his commitment to protect Social Security, not privatize it.\n\"America needs to keep its promise to seniors and those planning for the future by making it easier to save and strengthening important programs like Social Security,\" said Sen. Biden. \"Financial security - independence and a decent standard of living − is rapidly becoming a thing few feel confident they will have when they retire. The American promise that no one who works hard their whole life should end up with nothing is in jeopardy. We need to make it clear to all Americans that they can trust that their lifetime of hard work will be rewarded and protected.\"\n###\nA Secure Retirement: A Promise to Keep\nPreparing for retirement has never been more complicated. Fewer families can count on secure retirement income from defined benefit pension plans. Only 20 percent of private sector workers have pension plans - compared with 83 percent in the 1980s. Those that do have pensions worry about whether they will still be there when they retire. At the same time most families are hard pressed to find money to put aside in savings. Half of our workforce has no employer retirement plan. Families are tapped out after years of flat wage growth and rising costs of living. The personal saving rate is less than 1 percent. This not only threatens financial security of millions of families - it also jeopardizes our entire economy by increasing our need to borrow from foreign countries like China and Japan. Two-thirds of families headed by a worker between the ages of 55 and 64 have under $88,000 in personal retirement savings - scarcely enough to purchase an annuity paying $653 a month. More than half of American workers believe they will have to push back retirement. Security - independence and a decent standard of living − is rapidly becoming a thing few feel confident they will have when they retire. The American promise that no one who works hard their whole life should end up with nothing is in jeopardy.\nJoe Biden will keep the promise of a secure retirement by:\n\nSafeguarding Social Security\nExpanding Personal Saving\nCreating Kids Savings Accounts\nProtecting Pensions\nPreserving Retirement Investments\n\n1. Safeguarding Social Security\n\nProtect Social Security, Not Privatize It. Social Security is the foundation of retirement security for millions of Americans. For a typical worker retiring at age 65, Social Security replaces 40 percent of pre-retirement income. Joe Biden opposes privatization of Social Security. Social Security does not face an immediate crisis. With no changes, Social Security can pay full benefits through 2041. After that it can pay 74 percent of benefits. Joe Biden would bring Democrats and Republicans together to agree on options for keeping Social Security solvent including raising the cap on income subject to the Social Security tax so that the most wealthy shoulder their fair share ($97,500 is the maximum for 2007). This approach worked in 1983 when a bipartisan group of senior leaders from both parties put politics aside to fix Social Security.\n\n2. Expanding Personal Saving\nMake It Easier to Save:\n\nRequire Employers That Don't Provide Retirement Plans To Allow Employees To Contribute To Individual Retirement Accounts. In 2006, 40 percent of workers did not have any form of pension coverage - that's around 75 million workers who have no access to an employ-provided retirement plan. Joe Biden would require employers who do not adopt a 401(k) or other retirement plan to offer employees the ability contribute to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) by payroll deposit making it easier to save small amounts on a predictable, regular basis.\nExpand Automatic Enrollment in 401(k)s. Defined contribution retirement plans do not cover workers unless they sign up. Only about 1 in 4 eligible employees participate in such plans - missing out on tax advantages of saving and employer matching contributions. Automatic enrollment requires employees to opt-out of such plans - instead of requiring them to opt-in. Automatic enrollment has been shown to raise participation rates. Joe Biden would expand automatic enrollment in 401(k)s by increasing automatic enrollment by small and mid-sized employers, by expanding automatic enrollment to existing employees, and by increasing automatic contribution amounts.\n\nMake It Easier For Workers to Take Retirement Plans With Them:\n\nThe average worker can expect to change jobs several times which can result in navigating and managing several different retirement plans and investments. Joe Biden would make rollover of 401(k)s automatic so that accounts follow individuals.\n\nHelp Low and Moderate Income Families Save:\n\nMatch Contributions To Retirement Savings By Expanding Saver's Credit. Most retirement contributions are excluded from taxable income until they are distributed. Higher income taxpayers disproportionately benefit from tax deductions that promote savings because the value of tax incentives depends on what bracket the taxpayer is in - the higher the tax rate, the more the subsidies are worth. Those in lower tax brackets who most need to save have less benefit. Joe Biden would extend the Savers' Credit to make it a 50 percent refundable credit of up to $2,000 and index it to inflation to provide incentives to low-income households. Families with incomes below $50,000 that deposited $4,000 into a retirement account would receive a $2,000 match through the refund.\nEnd Rules That Penalize Retirement Saving: Many low-income families receive assistance through food stamp programs, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income. To be eligible they must meet an asset test as well as an income test. Asset tests count savings in 401(k)s or IRAs. Joe Biden would exclude retirement savings accounts from asset tests so that families with incomes low enough to qualify for assistance programs are not disqualified because of retirement savings.\n\n3. Starting Savings At Birth With $500 Kids Accounts\n\nInvest $500 In A Kids Account For Every Child Born After December 31, 2008. Joe Biden would create individual Kids Accounts for every child endowed with an initial contribution of $500 from the government. Kids Accounts would be redeemable for education expenses, home ownership or retirement beginning at age 18. Unused funds can be automatically rolled over into Individual Retirement Accounts at age 18.\nParents and Grandparents Could Contribute $1,000 A Year. Joe Biden would permit parents and grandparents to make a $1,000 after-tax contribution into Kids Accounts. Earnings in the account would be tax free.\nMatch Contributions For Low-Income Children. To encourage saving and investment Joe Biden would provide a dollar-for-dollar match on the first $500 contributed to the account for children in households earning below the national median income.\nKids Account Holders Would Repay Initial Deposit At Age 30. Joe Biden would require children who receive Kids Accounts to repay the government's deposit when they reach 30.\n\n4. Protecting Pensions\n\nStrengthen Workers Claims On Retirement Benefits. Executives should not have better pension protections during bankruptcy than workers. Joe Biden would tighten restrictions on \"Key Employee Retention Plans\" which are used to give executives bonuses while companies walk away from employee pensions. He would make any increases in executive pay and benefits up to two years before bankruptcy subject to special scrutiny by the court. Joe Biden would require that a company's foreign and domestic assets must be considered by the court when it considers voiding employees' contracts. Management should not be able to move assets overseas when they get into financial trouble and renege on their obligations to workers.\n\n5. Preserving Retirement Investments\n\nProtect Shareholders Rights. Joe Biden believes that shareholders have a critical role to play in corporate accountability. He would allow shareholders to have a vote in setting executive compensation and he would protect laws requiring executives to attest to the accuracy of a company's financial statements and to the soundness of internal controls. He was proud to fight for those safeguards in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A company that cannot or will not institute and maintain the internal controls necessary to meet the high standards of financial integrity and corporate accountability should not go public in the United States.\nIncrease Transparency and Help Workers Understand All Investment Options. Joe Biden would require retirement plan administrators to disclose fees and clearly identify the name, risk and investment objective of investment options. He would direct the Department of Labor to review compliance with these disclosure requirements and refer violations to the SEC and other enforcement agencies.\n\n",

    "text": "\nDes Moines, IA (September 21, 2007) - In the aftermath of last night's AARP forum in Davenport, the Biden for President campaign today accused Governor Bill Richardson of distorting his record on health care for seniors. At the event, Richardson made much of his experience as governor. He argued: \"I think I'm the only one here that has actually dealt with health care directly as a governor. In my state, we had to face the Bush cuts on Medicaid, but what we did is we made up for that shortfall.\"\nThe truth is, however, that in order to make up for \"that shortfall\" Governor Richardson imposed an $8.82 per day tax on nursing home beds in a scheme to raise revenue from the Federal Government for New Mexico's Medicaid program.\nRichardson's scheme to reimburse nursing homes for the tax to neutralize the effect on consumers backfired when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services declared the reimbursement plan illegal, leaving over 1,000 New Mexico seniors to foot the bill. Richardson was forced to repeal the \"bed tax credit\" in 2005 in order to qualify for federal funds, and the tax itself was repealed in 2006.\nIn fact, though, the effect of the scheme was far worse for New Mexico seniors, driving some from their nursing homes into financial dependency. As the Santa Fe New Mexican reported, \"Grown children of nursing-home residents told legislators Tuesday there must be a better way to raise money for Medicaid without taxing nursing homes an extra $3,500 a year … My mom worked hard and managed her resources so she wouldn't have to be dependent on her children,' said Pat Farnsworth, a daughter of a nursing-home resident in Albuquerque. 'This (tax) depletes her resources that much more quickly.' … Some families haven't been able to wait for an end-of-the-year credit, said Barbara Cormier, executive director of Montebello, a retirement community in Albuquerque. 'I listen to family members every day about their concern of how they're going to fund their parents' care,' she said. 'Several residents have left because the tax put them over the edge.'\" [Santa Fe New Mexican, 2/5/05]\n\"Of all the constituents of the Democratic Party, the group that deserves the straightest answers and most straightforward solutions is our senior population,\" said Biden for President Campaign Manager Luis Navarro. \"Governor Richardson likes to tout his gubernatorial experience as his principal qualification for president, but, as we have seen from President Bush, gubernatorial sleight-of-hand is not going to solve the problems of our nation. Especially when it comes to health care and retirement security, we need real solutions to the crisis at hand.\"\n",

    "text": "\n\nUrges Support For Biden-Brownback-Boxer Legislation\n\nWilmington, DE (September 23, 2007) - After four years of failed Iraq policies from the Bush White House, it is clear that we need a change of direction in Iraq. President Bush has decided to hand over the Iraq War to the next President, but there still needs to be a political solution in Iraq to make sure that our troops can leave Iraq without leaving chaos behind.\nAs such, next Tuesday, the U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote on the Biden-Brownback-Boxer amendment which calls for working with the Iraqis to transition the country into a federal system. Such a system, which Iraq's constitution already provides for, would give Iraq's people local control over their daily lives -- the police, education, jobs, government services, etc.\nMembers of the Senate from both sides of the political aisle have joined Senator Biden and others in calling for this new way forward. Senators John Kerry (D-MA), Bill Nelson (D-FL), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Blanche Lambert Lincoln (D-AR) and Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) are co-sponsoring the legislation. And, in an important display of bipartisanship, Senators Arlen Specter (R-PA), Gordon Smith (R-OR), and Kay Bailey Hutchinson (R-TX) are also supporting the amendment.\nThis weekend, the Biden for President Campaign released a petition calling on Americans to call the other presidential candidates in the Senate, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Chris Dodd to urge them to vote against the failed Bush administration policy of propping up a central government by supporting the Biden-Brownback-Boxer amendment.\nTo view the petition, go to: http://www.joebiden.com/getinvolved/petitions/iraq_vote\nThe text of the Biden Campaign email is below:\nAs it becomes clear that President Bush plans to pass the Iraq war off to our next President, the debate over our policy there has reached a fevered pitch in Washington, DC and around the country.\nSurge, Don't Surge, Timetables, Funding, Militias, Iran, Al Qaeda -- with all the lingo and spin being thrown around by everyone, it's easy to lose track of the most important factor that will determine what happens in Iraq.\nThat's the need for a political settlement in Iraq among Iraqis. Every Democrat and most Republicans agree there is no purely military way to stabilize Iraq -- there has to be a political settlement. That begs the question: what is that political settlement?\nWhen you boil it all down, there are really only two choices in Iraq:\n\nContinue to support, as President Bush has done, the idea that a strong central government will emerge in Iraq that will pull the country together, or\nRealize that there is too much hatred and distrust for the various groups to reach consensus on the big issues, and begin to establish a federal system -- where each region of Iraq is given a great deal of control over its laws and government.\n\nPresident Bush, and many Democrats continue to cling to choice #1, hoping against hope that if we just keep enough troops in Iraq long enough, or threaten to leave one more time, we can build or force unity where none exists.\nFive years into this war, what's left for us to say to the Iraqi government? \"We really, really, REALLY mean it this time.\"\nIt's time to abandon this strategy. It's not working.\nI have called for a loose, federal system with strong regional governments for more than a year now, as Iraq's constitution provides. It would give Iraq's people local control over their daily lives -- the police, education, jobs, government services, etc. And people from both sides of the political aisle are joining me to try to make this a reality.\nSenators Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and I introduced the Biden-Brownback-Boxer amendment, which calls for working with the Iraqis to transition the country into a federal system, as their Constitution allows and securing the support of the United Nations and Iraq's neighbors for this plan.\nMajority Leader Harry Reid has called on Dems to unite in support for the measure and Senators John Kerry (D-MA), Bill Nelson (D-FL), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Blanche Lambert Lincoln (D-AR) and Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) have joined us as co-sponsors. In an important display of bipartisanship, Senators Arlen Specter (R-PA), Gordon Smith (R-OR), and Kay Bailey Hutchinson (R-TX) are also supporting the amendment.\nMAJORITY LEADER REID HAS SCHEDULED A VOTE ON THE AMENDMENT FOR 10 A.M. ON TUESDAY.So now, more than ever, we need your help.\nThere are 3 things you can do today to help us reach the only viable political solution in Iraq and begin to bring our troops home without leaving a bloodbath behind.\n1. Click here to sign our petition in support of the Biden-Brownback-Boxer amendment. We will send your signatures to other members of the House and Senate to convince them to support the amendment.\n2. Call the presidential candidates in the Senate, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Chris Dodd to urge them to vote against the failed Bush administration's policy of propping up a central government by supporting our Biden-Brownback-Boxer amendment.\nHillary Clinton: (202) 224-4451\nBarack Obama: (202) 224-2854\nChris Dodd: (202) 224-2823\n3. Call the other presidential candidates, Bill Richardson and John Edwards, and tell them to support a federal system in Iraq by supporting the Senators behind the Biden-Brownback-Boxer amendment.\nBill Richardson: (505) 828-2455\nJohn Edwards: (919) 636-3131\nAs I said earlier, the choice is pretty stark: you either think the central government in Iraq can get the job done or you don't. It's time for our nation's leaders, especially the ones campaigning to be President, to take a stand.\nI know where I stand.\nJoin me to convince others that this is the best way to end the war and avoid a total catastrophe when we leave. Your action today will help shape this debate. Please act and forward this message to others who care about what's going on in Iraq.\nThank you,\nJoe Biden\n",

This marks the 9th Iowa legislative endorsement for the campaign, which currently includes five members of the House Leadership team.\nRep. Bukta has been a leading voice in the Iowa Legislature since 1996, when she was first elected. In just her second term, she was elected to serve on the Leadership team, and this past November she was selected to serve as Speaker Pro Tempore.\n\"I've known Joe Biden for over 20 years. His loyalty and honesty are second to none - and those are two critical qualities I am looking for in the next President\" said Rep. Bukta. \"However, perhaps even more important to me, is how we are going to bring our men and women home from Iraq safely. Joe Biden is the only candidate with a thoughtful and sensible political plan to do just that.\"\nBukta, a lifelong educator, recently retired after 33 years in the Clinton Community School District, where she taught 5th grade. She currently serves on the Education, Transportation, Veterans Affairs and Local Government Committees.\n\"Polly represents the best our party has to offer\" said Sen. Biden. \"She is a mom, a school teacher, and a leading legislator in Iowa. She is a woman who knows what it takes to bring both parties together in delivering results for Iowa's families.\"\nBukta joins eight Democratic legislators in a growing list of elected officials supporting Joe Biden in the Hawkeye state: State Sen. Joe Seng (Davenport), House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (Des Moines), Rep. John Whitaker (Hillsboro), Rep. Doris Kelley (Waterloo) Rep. Lisa Heddens (Ames), Rep. Jim Lykam (Davenport), Rep.

    "text": "\n\nBIDEN: \"Administration, Congress Must Recommit to Fighting Crime\"\n\nWashington, DC - U.S. Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, renewed his call to fully fund the successful COPS program in light of the FBI annual report detailing nationwide increases in violent crime for the second consecutive year.\n\"This report should be received as a wake up call by the Administration and by Congress that we are failing in one of our most important responsibilities - to protect American families and American communities from crime,\" said Sen. Biden. \"We need to recommit ourselves to the balanced, comprehensive approach to fighting crime that brought crime rates down throughout the 1990s - prevention and treatment programs, strong federal support for state and local law enforcement, tough but fair criminal laws, and prisons that provide offenders with the skills and resources to reenter our communities as productive, law-abiding citizens.\"\nYesterday the FBI released its 2006 crime report based on data from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) database. For the second consecutive year, there were measurable increases in violent crime nationwide. This is the first time the crime rate has risen for two years in a row since the passage of the 1994 Biden Crime Bill. Small and mid-sized cities experienced increases in the number of murders and robberies, with violent crimes increasing 1.9 percent nationally. In 2005, the FBI found that murders were up 3.4 percent - the largest percentage increase in 15 years - with 16,692 murders in 2005 - the most since 1998. Yesterday's report indicates that murders rose an additional 1.8 percent in 2006. Violent crime refers to acts of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.\n\"The good news is we know how to fix the problem - combined with effective prevention programs, more police mean safer streets,\" said Sen. Biden. \"Back in the 1990s, we faced a similar violent crime crisis. We stepped up to the plate and passed the most sweeping anti-crime bill in our history. The centerpiece of this landmark bill was the Community Oriented Policing Services Program - the COPS program. We funded 118,000 local officers, expanding community policing across the nation. And it worked - crime rates fell for eight straight years. Violent crime dropped 26 percent; the murder rate dropped 34 percent.\"\n\"Since September 11, the Administration has also reassigned 1,000 FBI agents previously dedicated to fighting crime to the counterterrorism mission,\" Sen. Biden continued. \"We need to replace those agents and bring the crime fighting capability of the FBI back to full strength. We must insist on giving all law enforcement, federal, state, and local, the tools and resources they need to keep our neighborhoods safe.\"\nIn May 2007, Sen. Biden chaired a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs about the federal role in helping communities prevent and respond to violent crime. Across the board, leaders of national law enforcement organizations, including the National Sheriffs Association, the National Association of Police Organizations, the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the U.S. Conference of Mayors, concurred that budgetary cuts to the Community Oriented Policing Service (COPS) program, created by Senator Biden in 1994, have contributed to the rise in violent crime and adversely affected local crime prevention and local law enforcement initiatives.\nAt the hearing, Senator Biden said, \"The federal government has taken its focus off street crime since 9/11, asking law enforcement to do more with less ... fewer police on the street preventing crime and protecting communities means more crime - it's as simple that.\"\nThe UCR Program was created in 1929 by the International Association of Chiefs of Police to provide reliable, standardized crime statistics for the nation. Each year, nearly 17,000 law enforcement agencies voluntarily provide crime reporting data, and this information is compiled to evaluate and track the levels and types of crimes committed in the county. For over 70 years, the FBI has collected and published these statistics. To read the 2006 FBI Uniform Crime Report, please visit http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/index.html\n",

    "text": "\n\nSeen As First Major Step To Ending U.S. Involvement In Iraq\n\nWilmington, DE - In a major repudiation of President Bush's failed policy in Iraq, Sen. Joe Biden's plan for a federal system in Iraq passed the Senate today by a vote of 75-23, garnering key bipartisan support from leaders of both parties in the U.S. Senate. In May of 2006, Sen. Biden, along with President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations Leslie H. Gelb, announced a detailed plan for promoting a political settlement in Iraq that would allow our troops to leave, without leaving chaos behind. The plan called for a decentralized, federal system in Iraq, which would give its people local control over the fabric of their daily lives, including police, jobs, education and government services. A limited central government would be responsible for protecting Iraq's borders and distributing its oil revenues.\nSen. Biden's amendment today to the Defense Authorization Bill is based on his federalism plan for Iraq and is a product of his year-long effort working across the aisle to build support. During the vote, Sen. Biden's plan secured the support of key leaders in the U.S. Senate from both parties, including Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin (D-MI), former Chairman John Warner (R-VA) and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Richard Lugar (R-IN). Last December, Sen. Biden became the first Democrat to oppose President Bush's proposed surge of additional troops in Iraq, stating at the time, that the only way to end this war was to build a bipartisan consensus opposed to President Bush's policy.\n\"For the first time in this incredibly divisive national debate we've been having about Iraq, a strong bi-partisan majority of senators - including fully half of the Republicans - has voted to change course,\" said Sen. Biden. \"It's the first time there is some real hope that we can put ourselves on a course to leave Iraq without leaving chaos behind.\"\nSen. Biden's amendment also has 17 sponsors: Joe Biden (D-DE), Sam Brownback (R-KS), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Arlen Specter (R-PA), John Kerry (D-MA), Gordon Smith (R-OR), Bill Nelson (D-FL), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Blanche Lincoln (D-AR), Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) Harry Reid (D-NV), Diane Feinstein (D-CA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Ken Salazar (D-CO) and Tom Carper (D-DE).\n\"Slowly but surely, we're building a consensus in the Congress around a way forward in Iraq. That's significant, because it's the only real way to end this war,\" said Sen. Biden. \"Everyone agrees that there is no military solution in Iraq, only a political solution. That begs the question: so, what is your political solution? We have an obligation to answer that question and today, leaders from both parties answered with one voice.\"\nThe Biden amendment states that the U.S. should actively support a political settlement among Iraqis based on the provisions of Iraq's constitution that call for creating a federal system of government, with strong regions and a limited central government. It also urged the administration to bring in the international community - including the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Iraq's neighbors - to support a settlement based on federalism and to convene a conference with Iraqis to help them reach that settlement.\n\"The Bush Administration is pursuing a fundamentally flawed political strategy in Iraq. They believe that if we just give it enough time, a democratic central government in Baghdad will emerge that secures the support of Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. Others believe that the mere fact of us leaving will force Iraqis to come together at the national level. In my judgment, both are wrong,\" said Sen. Biden. \"There is no trust within the government in Baghdad; no trust of the government by the people; no capacity on the part of the government to deliver basic security or services; and no prospect the government will develop that trust and capacity anytime soon.\"\n\"Simply put, absent an occupation we cannot sustain or a dictator we cannot support, Iraq cannot be governed from the center at this point in its history. In my opinion, supporting a decentralized Iraq with strong regional governments and a limited central government is the only way we can end this war without leaving chaos behind,\" added Sen. Biden.\n\"This may be President Bush's war. But it is America's future. Together, we have to get this right. Today, we are one step closer to doing just that,\" said Sen. Biden.\nA few key facts about the Biden amendment:\n\nThe legislation does not tell Iraqis what to do. It speaks only to what U.S. policy should be.\nFederalism is not a U.S. or foreign imposition on Iraq. Iraq's own constitution calls a \"decentralized, federal system\" and sets out the powers of the regions (extensive) and those of the central government (limited). The Constitution also says that in case of conflict between regional and national law, regional law prevails.\nFederalism is not partition. In fact, it's probably the only way to prevent partition or, even worse, the total fragmentation of Iraq.\nFederalism will not accelerate sectarian cleansing; it's the only way to stop it. Iraqis are already voting with their feet, as yesterday's article in the New York Times demonstrates. Before the surge, Iraqis were fleeing their homes at a rate of about 40,000 month; now, it's about 100,000 a month. Unless Iraqis come to some kind of agreement on sharing power peacefully, the cleansing will continue.\n\nSen. Biden's plan for Iraq has received accolades and bipartisan support from public officials, former Secretaries of State, foreign policy experts and editorial pages across the country [see below].\nPUBLIC OFFICIALS ON THE BIDEN PLAN FOR IRAQ\nSenator Barbara Boxer (D-CA): \"What Senator Biden has understood for several years now, and why I was so interested in supporting him from the very start as a proud member of his Foreign Relations Committee, is we have to deal with the Iraq we have, not the Iraq we wish we had. If that sounds similar to someone--I understand that is a similar sentence. But we don't have an Iraq that we romantically wish we had. After all, as Senator Biden has said many times, for Iraq to survive and thrive, they have to want democracy as much as we want it for them. I think that quote by Senator Biden has been in my mind since the very start of this war that I did not vote for. So I see a light at the end of a very dark tunnel—a darkness that is impacting our Nation.\" [Congressional Record, 9/25/07]\n\"With your leadership, sometime ago, the United States devised a plan that allowed Serbs, Croats and Bosnian Muslims their autonomy with power sharing. And that is the model that makes sense for Iraq today. A continuing military surge is not the answer. We need a diplomatic surge. And that is what your proposal allows us to do.\" [Press Conference, 6/7/07]\n\"Our chairman has come forward with a vision of how this thing can end up in a place where people will stop killing each other, and yet keep together the country of Iraq, to do the things a country has to do, including making sure the oil is shared in a fair way. It's not three separate countries -- he's gotten a rap on that; never was -- always semi-autonomous; policing by your own people; trust built up in that kind of situation. It's just what's happening in Kurdistan.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/31/07]\nSenator Bill Nelson (D-FL): \"At the end of the day, you have to have a plan that the players in the region are going to buy into, all of those neighbors of Iraq as well as the U.N. Security Council. What is the one plan that can bring all those people together? And that is this plan, a federal kind of plan that is allowed under the existing Iraqi constitution.\" [Press Conference, 6/7/07]\nSenator Richard Lugar (R-IN): \"My own view is that… we have to continually advise our friends in Iraq to get on with this question of the division of the oil money or the dedication of the various groups, as well as how a federation can work.\n\"It may not be an absolute division of the country into three parts, but at least some ways in which the Kurds, who already have a great deal of autonomy, are joined by a lot of Shiites that want the same thing and Sunnis that are worried that they're going to be left out of the picture. And that takes heavy lifting. Politically, a lot of objections even to bringing it up before their congress, but we have to keep insisting that they do. That has to be on the agenda.\" [PBS Newshour with Jim Lehrer, 9/19/2006]\nSenator Sam Brownback (R-KS): \"I think this idea of maybe the three autonomous regions within one country may be the one that we start to move more and more towards.\" [The Hill, 10/24/06]\nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX): \"Allowing the Kurds, Sunni and Shia to govern their own territories while sharing in Iraq's oil revenues through a national revenue stream could help quell the bloodletting.\" [Houston Chronicle, 10/17/06]\nSenator Chuck Schumer (D-NY): \"Mr. Schumer said, he hopes that a controversial plan strongly advocated by Senator Joe Biden of Delaware—which essentially calls for the dissolution of Iraq into three autonomous ethnic enclaves (and which Mr. Schumer quietly supported last year) —will emerge as a concrete Democratic alternative to current administration policy. \"It may actually move into play,\" said Mr. Schumer. \"I've always believed that the Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds hate each other more than they will ever love any central government.\" [New York Observer, 11/20/2006]\nBill Richardson, Governor of New Mexico: \"I would also study Senator Biden's federation [proposal]. I think that may be ultimately the right solution.\" [Christian Science Monitor, 9/27/06]\nMuwaffaq al-Rubaie, National Security Advisor of Iraq: \"I don't think Senator Biden has said that Iraq should be divided into three sections. What I think -- and I can't agree more with Senator Biden and his article, and I think he is a very well-informed person. What we are talking here -- and he's talking about Iraqi constitution. The constitution of Iraq has said very clearly that you can form provinces, regions, federal -- this is a democratic federal system, and any two or three or nine or 10 provinces can get together and form a region, and form a federal unit. And this is exactly what Joseph Biden is saying, or I believe when I read his article… I think Biden's idea is a good idea, with some modification because it's very compatible with our permanent constitution, which was ratified on the 15th of October last year.\" [CNN Late Edition, 5/7/06]\nCongressman Chris Van Hollen: \"Democrats have been making some of the most creative proposals. Senator Biden has a proposal for reconciliation in Iraq, but the stay the course rhetoric you hear from this administration clearly isn't getting us anywhere, things are getting worse not better. [T]he American people want a congress that's going to deal with this issue in reality not in the fantasy world.\" [MSNBC Live, 10/20/06]\nGeneral Jay Garner, former director, Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Affairs in Iraq: \"[Biden] is the only one of our sparring politicians who has laid out a realistic plan for pacifying Iraq. Everyone else just gives us rhetoric while Iraq slides toward civil war.\" [Congress Daily, 7/31/07]\nFORMER SECRETARIES OF STATE ON THE BIDEN PLAN FOR IRAQ\nFormer Secretary of State Henry Kissinger: \"It is possible that the present structure in Baghdad is incapable of national reconciliation because its elected constituents were elected on a sectarian basis. A wiser course would be to concentrate on the three principal regions and promote technocratic, efficient and humane administration in each. The provision of services and personal security coupled with emphasis on economic, scientific and intellectual development may represent the best hope for fostering a sense of community. More efficient regional government leading to substantial decrease in the level of violence, to progress towards the rule of law and to functioning markets could then, over a period of time, give the Iraqi people an opportunity for national reconciliation — especially if no region is strong enough to impose its will on the others by force. Failing that, the country may well drift into de facto partition under the label of autonomy, such as already exists in the Kurdish region.\" [Washington Post, 9/16/07]\nFormer Secretary of State Henry Kissinger: \"I'm sympathetic to an outcome that permits large regional autonomy. In fact, I think it is very likely that this will emerge out of the conflict that we are now witnessing.\"\n\"If the Iraqis cannot solve the problems that have been described, I've told the Chairman privately, that I thought that this [a federal system in Iraq] was a possible outcome, and at the right moment we should work in the direction that will (inaudible) for maximum stability and for maximum chances of peace.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/31/07]\nFormer Secretary of State Madeleine Albright: \"[T]he idea of the… constitution of Iraq [as] written, which allows for and mandates, in fact, a great deal of regional autonomy, is appropriate. I think there are certain central powers that a government needs. Some of it has to do with the oil revenue and various other parts. So without endorsing any plan, I do think reality here sets in that there will be regional autonomy.\"\n\"[W]hen asked about Senator Biden's plan, I have said that, in fact, it is an attempt to keep the country together, which I do believe is what it is about. I'm just talking about in the long run what might happen that we do have to watch out for. But I think it is very clear from my reading of the plan that it is done in order to keep the country together. And I do think that is an essential point.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/31/07]\nFormer Secretary of State James Baker: \"…I was and still am interested in the proposal that Senator Biden and Les Gelb put forward with respect to the idea that ultimately you may end up with three autonomous regions in Iraq, because I was worried that there are indications that that might be happening, in fact, on the ground anyway and, if it is, we ought to be prepared to try and manage the situation. So we have a sentence in our report that says, 'If events were to move irreversibly in this direction, the United States should manage the situation to ameliorate the humanitarian consequences, contain the violence and minimize regional stability.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/30/07]\nEDITORIAL PAGES AND COLUMNISTS ON BIDEN PLAN FOR IRAQ\nRichard Cohen, Washington Post Columnist: \"The way it [Iraq] should go was long ago devised by Joseph Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee … Biden and Leslie Gelb, president emeritus of the Council of Foreign Relations, advocate breaking Iraq into a federation consisting of three parts: a Kurdish north, a Sunni center and a Shiite south. Those terms -- north, center and south -- are the vaguest approximations, but they represent a thought, or a despair, or a resignation: The only way Iraq is going to work is if we concede that it is not likely to work the way we wanted it to…\n\"Since the Biden-Gelb plan was promulgated four years ago, the vaunted facts on the ground have initiated its implementation. Iraqis of one sort or another are drawing into themselves, circling the proverbial wagons so that they remain safely with their own kind and creating somewhat autonomous regions. Presently, Iraqis are fleeing their homes at the rate of 100,000 a month -- Sunnis moving to Sunni areas, Shiites to Shiite ones and the Kurds going nowhere because they already have what amounts to their own state….\n\"The main virtue of the Biden-Gelb plan is that it does not stand athwart history. It enlists it. The volcanic eruption of nationalism and sectarianism that drenched the 20th century in blood -- the Holocaust above all -- has not yet run its course. The farmer and the rancher, to put things in Rodgers and Hammerstein terms, will not be friends. East Africa ousted its Indian and Chinese merchants. Some of Asia did the same. Tutsi will murder Hutu, Bosnian Serb will murder Bosnian Muslim and the same thing would happen, incidentally, if a single-state solution of Muslims and Jews were imposed on Israel. Even Belgium threatens to come apart, French speakers (Walloons) and Dutch speakers (Flemish) going their own ways.\" [Washington Post, 9/25/07]\nCharles Krauthammer, Washington Post Columnist: \"A weak, partitioned Iraq is not the best outcome. We had hoped for much more. Our original objective was a democratic and unified post-Hussein Iraq. But it has turned out to be a bridge too far. We tried to give the Iraqis a republic, but their leaders turned out to be, tragically, too driven by sectarian sentiment, by an absence of national identity, and by the habits of suspicion and maneuver cultivated during decades in the underground of Saddam Hussein's totalitarian state…\n\"We now have to look for the second-best outcome. A democratic, unified Iraq might someday emerge. Perhaps today's ground-up reconciliation in the provinces will translate into tomorrow's ground-up national reconciliation. Possible, but highly doubtful. What is far more certain is what we are getting: ground-up partition.\" [Washington Post, 9/7/07]\nThomas Friedman, New York Times Columnist: \"The Kurdish autonomous zone should be our model for Iraq. Does George Bush or Condi Rice have a better idea? Do they have any idea? Right now, we're surging aimlessly. Iraq's only hope is radical federalism — with Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds each running their own affairs, and Baghdad serving as an A.T.M., dispensing cash for all three. Let's get that on the table — now.\" [New York Times, 8/29/07]\nDavid Brooks, New York Times Columnist: \"Most American experts and policy makers wasted the past few years assuming that change in Iraq would come from the center and spread outward. They squandered months arguing about the benchmarks that would supposedly induce the Baghdad politicians to make compromises. They quibbled over whether this or that prime minister was up to the job. They unrealistically imagined that peace would come through some grand Sunni-Shiite reconciliation.\n\"Now, at long last, the smartest analysts and policy makers are starting to think like sociologists. They are finally acknowledging that the key Iraqi figures are not in the center but in the provinces and the tribes. Peace will come to the center last, not to the center first. Stability will come not through some grand reconciliation but through the agglomeration of order, tribe by tribe and street by street.\n\"The big change in the debate has come about because the surge failed, and it failed in an unexpected way. The original idea behind the surge was that U.S. troops would create enough calm to allow the national politicians to make compromises. The surge was intended to bolster the \"modern\" — meaning nonsectarian and nontribal — institutions in the country. But the surge is failing, at least politically, because there are practically no nonsectarian institutions, and there are few nonsectarian leaders to create them. Security gains have not led to political gains.\" [New York Times, 9/4/07]\nEugene Robinson, Washington Post Columnist: \"Biden's plan is concrete and very well thought-out. I was skeptical at first - I thought the Turks would never accept even a semi-independent Kurdistan - but events may be heading in the direction of Biden's vision anyway. The Bush administration and its war policies remain committed to the idea of a unitary Iraq - no matter what's happening on the ground. Biden's idea of three basically autonomous mini-states ought to get more attention.\" [Washington Post Live Discussion, 6/5/07]\nMichael Hirsh, Newsweek Columnist: \"Joe Biden is dead right on Iraq….[Biden] has been on the record for a year with a fully thought-out vision for Iraq that offers a real alternative to the bleak choice we're getting from everyone else.\" [Newsweek.com, 4/26/07]\nThomas L. Friedman, New York Times columnist: \"[T]he person I think who has been where I've been from the very beginning, seeing the potential, you know, that this could have for a positive outcome but really, really cautious and worried all the time, that if we weren't doing it right is, Joe Biden. I think Joe Biden has been on top of this from the very beginning. He was on top of the opportunity. He was on top of what stakes we needed or what we needed to do to get some chance of realizing that opportunity and he's been top of saying this isn't working. [CNN The Situation Room, 4/20/2007]\nDavid Brooks, New York Times columnist: \"Senator Biden is the one exception. What happened Friday was significant with this intelligence report. It drove a missile right into the Bush policy. Because what it said was these two people, Sunni and Shia, will never get back together. That destroys the Bush policy. It drove a missile to the Democratic policy because it says we can't get out. So what's the other option? To me it's the soft partition idea that Joe Biden, lone among the leading Democrats, has been in favor of.\" [ABC This Week, 2/4/07]\n\"As Joe Biden points out, the Constitution already goes a long way toward decentralizing power. It gives the provinces the power to have their own security services, to send ambassadors to foreign countries, to join together to form regions. Decentralization is not an American imposition, it's an Iraqi idea. ….In short, logic, circumstances and politics are leading inexorably toward soft partition. The Bush administration has been slow to recognize its virtues because it is too dependent on the Green Zone Iraqis. The Iraqis talk about national unity but their behavior suggests they want decentralization. Sooner or later, everybody will settle on this sensible policy, having exhausted all the alternatives.\" [New York Times, Parting Ways In Iraq, 1/28/07]\n\"There is one option that does approach Iraqi reality from the bottom up. That option recognizes that Iraq is broken and that its people are fleeing their homes to survive. It calls for a ''soft partition'' of Iraq in order to bring political institutions into accord with the social facts -- a central government to handle oil revenues and manage the currency, etc., but a country divided into separate sectarian areas to reduce contact and conflict. When the various groups in Bosnia finally separated, it became possible to negotiate a cold (if miserable) peace. Soft partition has been advocated in different ways by Joe Biden and Les Gelb, by Michael O'Hanlon and Edward Joseph, by Pauline Baker at the Fund for Peace, and in a more extreme version, by Peter Galbraith.\" [New York Times, Breaking the Clinch, 1/25/07]\n\"The liberals who favor quick exit never grappled with the consequences of that policy, which the Baker-Hamilton commission terrifyingly described. The centrists who believe in gradual withdrawal never explained why that wouldn't be like pulling a tooth slowly. Joe Biden, who has the most intellectually serious framework for dealing with Iraq, was busy yesterday, at the crucial decision-making moment, conducting preliminary fact-finding hearings, complete with forays into Iraqi history.\" [New York Times, The Fog Over Iraq, 1/11/07]\nPhiladelphia Inquirer, Editorial Board: \"One shining exception to 'slogans over substance' is U.S. Sen. Joe Biden (D., Del.). Gutsily, he's put forth a plan for dividing Iraq into semi-autonomous Kurdish, Shiite and Sunni zones, with Baghdad as a federal city; a fair division of oil revenues; and U.S. troops nearby as a watchdog against neighbors' mischief. You can name a dozen ways Biden's approach could collapse. But at least he has put a reality-based proposal on the table. That's more than most of the people seeking your vote right now seem willing to do.\" [Philadelphia Inquirer, 10/1/06]\nDavid Broder, Washington Post columnist: \"At a time when most people see nothing but hopeless discord in Iraq, it is healthy to have someone offering alternatives that could produce progress.\" [Washington Post, 5/4/06]\nJackson Diehl, Washington Post columnist: \"Instead, the time may finally be ripe for some of the ideas that have been doggedly pushed for most of this year by Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden, who has been one of his party's most serious and responsible voices on Iraq... It's easy to find holes in this strategy, as with any other plan for Iraq... But Biden's basic idea -- of an external political intervention backed by an international alliance -- is the one big option the Bush administration hasn't tried.\" [Washington Post, 10/2/06]\nDavid Ignatius, Washington Post columnist: \"The Democrat who has tried hardest to think through these problems is Sen. Joseph Biden. He argues that the current government of national unity isn't succeeding in holding Iraq together, and that America should instead embrace a policy of 'federalism plus' that will devolve power to the Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish regions. Iraqis are already voting for sectarian solutions, Biden argues, and America won't stabilize Iraq unless it aligns its policy with this reality. I disagree with some of the senator's conclusions, but he's asking the right question: How do we fix Iraq?\" [Washington Post, 9/30/06]\nBill O'Reilly, Fox News: \"See, I favor Biden's—Senator Biden's solution of the three regional areas. Because you've already got one, the Kurds in the north that's autonomous.

You could even call it a turning point.\" [St. Louis Post-Dispatch (MO), 05/02/06]\nThe Journal Standard (IL) Editorial Board: \"Sen. Joe Biden [is] among the few Democrats offering something resembling a plan. On Sunday, he floated the idea of separating Iraq along sectarian lines into three largely autonomous states under the umbrella of a weak central government. That may or may not be the ideal policy. The point is we need to do something radically different. The alternative is a mission perpetually unfulfilled and ever more costly in American blood and treasure.\" [The Journal Standard (IL), 5/2/06]\nFOREIGN POLICY EXPERTS ON THE BIDEN PLAN FOR IRAQ\nMichael O'Hanlon, Senior Fellow, The Brookings Institution: \"The time may be approaching when the only hope for a more stable Iraq is a soft partition of the country. Soft partition would involve the Iraqis, with the assistance of the international community, dividing their country into three main regions. Each would assume primary responsibility for its own security and governance, as Iraqi Kurdistan already does. Creating such a structure could prove difficult and risky. However, when measured against the alternatives—continuing to police an ethno-sectarian war, or withdrawing and allowing the conflict to escalate— the risks of soft partition appear more acceptable. Indeed, soft partition in many ways simply responds to current realities on the ground, particularly since the February 2006 bombing of the Samarra mosque, a major Shi'i shrine, dramatically escalated intersectarian violence. If the U.S. troop surge, and the related effort to broker political accommodation through the existing coalition government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki fail, soft partition may be the only means of avoiding an intensification of the civil war and growing threat of a regional conflagration. While most would regret the loss of a multi-ethnic, diverse Iraq, the country has become so violent and so divided along ethno-sectarian lines that such a goal may no longer be achievable.\" [\"The Case for Soft Partition in Iraq,\" Brookings Institution Analysis Paper, 06/07]\n\"It would be preferable…to retain some level of multi-ethnic society... However, let's be clear about what the data show—it's happening already. And right now, it's the militias and the death squads that are driving the ethnic cleansing, and the movement towards a breakup of Iraq. And the question pretty soon is going to be whether we try to manage that process, or let the militias alone drive it, because it's happening. 100,000 people a month are being driven from their homes. Iraq looks like Bosnia more and more.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/10/07]\nFormer Iraq Defense Minister Ali Allawi: \"I think the solution has to be to really face the fact that the invasion, occupation of the country has led to really enormous consequences, not only inside the Iraq but in the region. Unless you administer and control the effects of the invasion, you're unlikely to have much peace. And to do that I think you have to take into account that certain irreversible changes have taken place, especially, for example, the empowerment of the Shiite community, the empowerment of the Kurds, and the effects of that on the various countries of the Middle East.\nJON STEWART: So you see sort of a central government, kind of existing to mediate between Kurds, Shi'a, and Sunni, but then they also have autonomy of their own?\nAllawi: I think so. In the long term, if you want to have a nation state, these components have to be brought together again. You have to reweave the structures of the country and society. And a central government that is based on a kind of federal arrangement is possibly the best outcome.\" [The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, 4/18/07]\nAmbassador Dennis Ross, Counselor and Ziegler Distinguished Fellow, The Washington Institute for Near East Policy: \"The only thing I would say, though, as I've noted before, with 100,000 Iraqis being displaced a month, you're beginning to create the outlines of that on the ground [a federal system in Iraq]. So I was actually in favor of the idea before, and I think it may have more of a potential now because of that reality.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/17/07]\nAmbassador Richard Haass, President Council on Foreign Relations: \"I've long admired the chairman's idea [Of a federal system in Iraq]…The problem is—it's also put forward by my predecessor—the problem is not the idea. The idea's a reasonable idea; it's a good idea. The problem facing the idea is that it's a reasonable idea that's been introduced into an unreasonable political environment. If Iraqis were willing to sign on to this idea of distribution of political and economic power and so forth, federalism, all Iraqis would be better off and a large part of the problem would fade. The problem is that we can't get Iraqis to sign on to a set of arrangements that, quite honestly, would leave the bulk of them better off. We can't force them to be reasonable. And at the moment, they've essentially embarked on a path which is in some ways self- destructive of a society. So again—but the flaw is not inherent in the ideas; it's just, again, we can't—the very reasonableness that's at the heart of the chairman's idea is rejected again by -- virtually across the board, particularly by Shi'a and Sunnis, because they can't agree on the precise balance, if you will, of political and economic power within their society. So at the moment, there's not yet a federal scheme they would sign on to.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/17/07]\n\nYahia Said, Director, Iraq Revenue Watch: \"I think the constitution, the Iraqi constitution, with all its shortcomings, serves as a good starting point for dialogue. But the constitution needs to be transformed through genuine dialogue from a dysfunctional to a rational federal structure. Oil and negotiations on an oil deal, which have apparently concluded recently, also provide a model for the -- for that rational federalism. The main principles that the negotiators have agreed on is to maximize the benefit of Iraq's oil wells to all Iraqis, to use oil as a way to unite the nation, and to build a framework based on transparency, which is very important in a situation of lack -- of poor trust, and on efficiency and equity.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing, 1/10/07]\nFormer UN Ambassador Richard Holbrooke: \"I urge [President Bush] to lay out realistic goals, redeploy our troops and focus on the search for a political solution. We owe that to the Iraqis who welcomed the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and put their trust in us, only to find their lives in danger as a result. By a political solution, I mean something far more ambitious than current U.S. efforts aimed at improving the position of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki by changing ministers or setting timelines for progress. Sen. Joe Biden and Les Gelb have advocated what they call, in a reference to the negotiations that ended the war in Bosnia in 1995, a \"Dayton-like\" solution to the political situation -- by which they mean a looser federal structure with plenty of autonomy for each of the three main groups, and an agreement on sharing oil revenue.\" [Washington Post, 10/24/06]\nAmbassador Peter W. Galbraith: \"And, Mr. Chairman, if I may say, I am often asked what is the difference between the plan that you and Les Gelb put forward and the plan that I have outlined. And I would say that the central point is what they share is that we believe that the future of Iraq is up to the Iraqis. You and Les Gelb are more optimistic about what that future might bring. And if you're right, I think that would be terrific.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, 1/11/07]\n\nDr. Ted Galen Carpenter, Vice President for Defense and Foreign Policy Studies, CATO Institute: \"And I believe there is a regional -- there is a reasonable prospect of convincing even Iran and Syria that a proxy war can easily spiral out of control and it would not be in their best interests to tolerate that kind of development, that it is better to quarantine this conflict and allow the dynamics in Iraq to play themselves out. Perhaps at some point the various factions in Iraq will agree on compromise, either a reasonably peaceful, formal partition, or a very loose federation with adequate political compromise. But they have to determine that. We cannot determine that for them.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, 1/11/07].\n\nWalter Russell Mead, Council on Foreign Relations: \"I thought that the Joe Biden op-ed … in the Wall Street Journal yesterday was also a very sober and thoughtful approach.\nJIM LEHRER: For those who didn't read that, capsulize it for us.\nMead: Well, they were basically talking about a way forward in Iraq that would have some bipartisan support, and something that the administration could work with.

He's the most uninformed person in American foreign policy and now running for president, number one.\"\nBiden Campaign Manager Luis Navarro also pointed out that several of the Democratic candidates showed serious errors in judgment related to critical issues of national security.\nNavarro said, \"Sen.

His plan for a federal system in Iraq passed the Senate today by a vote of 75-23 garnering overwhelming support from a bipartisan group of leaders of both parties.

Today, in a truly historic moment, the United States Senate passed an amendment sponsored by Sen. Joe Biden that puts forth a political solution to end the war in Iraq. Sen. Biden's persistent leadership on ending the war finally gives Americans hope that the United States can put itself on track to leave Iraq without leaving chaos behind in the region. The overwhelming bipartisan support of the amendment - which both Senators Harkin and Grassley voted for - underscores Sen. Biden's ability to unify our leaders on the most important issue facing the country.\"\nToday's vote resulted in an overwhelming 75-23 majority, with over half of the Senate's Republicans joining Democrats in support of Biden's amendment. For over a year and a half, Sen. Joe Biden has been promoting a political solution in Iraq based on a federal government called for in the Iraqi constitution. His plan calls for a decentralized, federal system in Iraq, which would give its people local control over the fabric of their daily lives, including police, jobs, education and government services.\n\"In recent weeks, nine Iowa legislators have endorsed Joe Biden for President\" McCarthy continued. \"While we all may have some varying reasons for doing so, we share one common belief and that is that Joe Biden is uniquely qualified to end this war in Iraq. Time and time again throughout his 35-year career in the Senate, he has rolled up his sleeves, worked across the aisle, and brought people to a consensus. Today was just another example of his ability to be a true leader. The Senator's ongoing leadership and victory today in the Senate will translate well with Iowa caucus-goers.\"\nMcCarthy is joined by eight Democratic legislators in a growing group of elected officials supporting Joe Biden in the Hawkeye state: State Sen. Joe Seng (Davenport), House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (Des Moines), Rep. John Whitaker (Hillsboro), Rep. Doris Kelley (Waterloo) Rep. Lisa Heddens (Ames), Rep. Jim Lykam (Davenport), Rep.

    "text": "\nWashington, DC - Today, Senator Biden, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, met with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani. President Talabani welcomed the Senate's approval of the Biden-Brownback amendment last week supporting federalism in Iraq, on a bipartisan vote of 75-23. He expressed his strong belief that the amendment promotes the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq and is not, as some have mischaracterized it, a call for partition. He also emphasized that the amendment is completely consistent with the decision Iraqis have made to adopt a federal form of government in their Constitution.\nIn addition, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, speaking in Arabic on Tuesday to al-Iraqiyah Television, made the following remarks regarding the Biden-Brownback Federalism Amendment: \"They said they welcomed federalism. If federalism is what they really meant, why not? Federalism, after all, is stipulated in the Constitution. We, too, talked about federalism as this is a constitutional issue.\"\nSenator Biden said, \"I welcome President Talabani's support for the Biden-Brownback amendment, and also Prime Minster Maliki's comments. Some - both in the United States and Iraq - have tried to mischaracterize our amendment as calling for the partition of Iraq. It is nothing of the sort. It calls for keeping Iraq together by bringing to life the federal system enshrined in its constitution. A federal Iraq is a united Iraq and the best path to a political settlement that virtually everyone agrees is necessary if we are to leave Iraq without leaving chaos behind.\"\n",

    "text": "\n\nKeeps Promise To The Nation's Children To Strengthen Public Education\n\nDes Moines, IA (October 4, 2007): Today at East High School in Des Moines, IA, Sen. Joe Biden proposed a plan to give every child in America access to 16 years of public education by providing two years of preschool to every child and at least two years of higher education.\n\"My mother has an expression: 'Children tend to become that which you expect of them.' I want a country where we expect much from America's children,\" said Sen. Biden. \"Every child must graduate from high school. Every qualified student should get a minimum of an associate's degree.\"\nSen. Biden pledged to expand early childhood development programs, including doubling the number of students in Head Start programs and quadrupling the number in Early Head Start and provide grants to states to expand high quality preschool programs.\nSen. Biden would make sure that, at a minimum, all students can afford at least two years of college by providing a $3,000 College ACCESS refund —equivalent to a $12,000 deduction—that would fully cover the average cost of tuition and fees at a two-year college and cover more than half the cost of tuition and fees at a public four-year college. The ACCESS program also provides low-income students with up to $9,300 of tuition assistance a year through the expansion of Pell Grants to $6,300.\n\"Today just two-thirds of students entering high school graduate and about two-thirds of those go on to college,\" said Sen. Biden. \"We are losing too many children in this country, wasting too much talent, leaving so much potential untapped. We know what we need to do: First, stop focusing just on test scores. Second, start education earlier. Third, pay educators more. Fourth, reduce class size. Fifth, make higher education affordable.\"\nSen. Biden also announced initiatives to reduce class size and improve teacher pay. Joe Biden would hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce the average class size to 18 students, particularly in the early grades, by providing $2 billion a year in grants to states and districts to help them hire more teachers and provide incentives to attract new teachers.\n",

    "text": "\nDes Moines, IA (October 5, 2007): Yesterday, reports in the New York Times revealed that the Bush Administration authorized U.S. personnel to torture detainees and subject them to inhumane interrogation techniques. The authorization came in the form of secret Justice Department memoranda issued by new Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in 2005, just months after the Department had publicly withdrawn a prior memo condoning torture, stating, \"Torture is abhorrent both to American law and values and to international norms.\"\nAccording to the Times, officials briefed on the secret memos regarded them as an \"expansive endorsement of the harshest interrogation techniques ever used by the Central Intelligence Agency.\" The memos, the officials said, for the \"first time provided explicit authorization to barrage terror suspects with a combination of painful physical and psychological tactics.\"\nSen. Biden issued the following statement:\n\"This is an outrage and an embarrassment to the nation and is further proof that you cannot trust this Administration. Before these memos were drafted, the Administration publicly denied their use of torture and now it is clear to all that they were not telling the truth.\n\"These abhorrent policies have made us less safe in the world. The shirking of responsibility by this White House, from blaming Abu Ghraib on lower-level officers and firing others for their own incompetent Iraq policies, is a disturbing pattern of behavior that must come to an end.\n\"We need a change of direction in America. The American people need a White House they can be proud of here at home and one that commands respect abroad. As President, I will make that change my first priority.\"\nIn July, Sen. Biden introduced the National Security with Justice Act to reform United States policies on the apprehension, detention, treatment and transfer of suspected terrorists. The legislation, among other things, unambiguously prohibits any United States personnel, including members of our intelligence services, from torturing and mistreating detainees. Specifically, Senator Biden's bill closes this loophole by prohibiting all officers and agents of the United States from using techniques of interrogation not authorized by the United States Army Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation.\nThe legislation also closes black sites and extra-judicial prisons, prohibits extraordinary renditions, prohibits the torture and mistreatment of detainees in U.S. custody, modifies the definition of \"unlawful enemy combatant,\" and extends habeas corpus to detainees.\n",

Smith, a former co-chair of Gov. Bill Richardson's Campaign, cited Sen. Biden's leadership on Iraq as his reason for leaving the Richardson organization.\n\"For me, it comes down to who is best equipped to deal with the war in Iraq. And, over the last few weeks, it has become clear to me that Joe Biden is the only candidate with the ideas, leadership and experience to get us out of Iraq without leaving chaos behind,\" said State Rep. Fletcher Smith. \"I've had several members of my family, from my grandfather down to two of my siblings, serve proudly in our nation's military so it's especially important to me that we end this war in a way that keeps our troops safe and does not require us to send them back in the months or years ahead. I believe that only by adopting Biden's comprehensive plan for a federalized Iraq will we truly be able to do this and reduce the overall threat to our country.\"\nSmith, who represents District 23 in Greenville County, has served in the South Carolina House of Representatives since 1997 and is a member of the South Carolina Legislative Black Caucus. Prior to being elected to the House, he served as Greenville County Councilman from 1989-1996.\nSen.

Brownback. \"Decentralizing power in Iraq offers the best chance for Iraqis to live in a peaceful, united country where they can resolve their differences. It is time to begin the political surge we desperately need to help stabilize Iraq so we can get our troops out of harm's way.\"\n\"Partisan politics must not come in the way of finding a solution to the war in Iraq,\" said Sen. Biden. \"The overwhelming majority of Americans want us to get our troops out of Iraq as quickly as possible without leaving chaos behind.

Biden is the only Democratic candidate for President who has voted to fund the troops in Iraq.

Biden issued the following statement in response to Governor Bill Richardson's position on the Iraq war and his comments on the historic, bipartisan support for the Biden-Brownback-Boxer resolution:\n\"Governor Richardson's remarks today on my Iraq plan were surprising. First, he was in favor of my plan, now he's attacking it. First, he said he would take all of our troops out in six months, and now he acknowledges it would take a year. First, he said he would leave residual forces in Iraq, and now he says he wouldn't. First, he was in favor of diplomacy followed by withdrawal, now he says it's the other way around. When it comes to the single most important issue facing our country - how to end the war in Iraq responsibly - it is important to be clear and consistent. It is especially important on this issue that there be no gap between what we say as candidates and what we would do as president.\n\"My plan for Iraq has overwhelming bipartisan support. More and more people acknowledge that while leaving Iraq is necessary, it is not enough. We also have to do everything we can not to leave chaos behind. The only way to do that is through the political solution that I put forward, which has been embraced by the Senate, the Iraqis and the foreign policy community. I suggest that Governor Richardson go back and review his record and statements and reconsider today's remarks.\"\nBILL RICHARDSON'S \"WAFFLING\" POLICY ON IRAQ\n\"There's no confusion or ambiguity or waffling in my position\"\n-- Bill Richardson on Iraq [Richardson Email to supporters, 8/30/07]\nGovernor Bill Richardson has made his resume and foreign policy credentials a central theme of his campaign for President, but in recent weeks has been criticized for making \"mistakes.\" Richardson's policy towards the toughest problem facing America - the war in Iraq - has been, at best, inconsistent. He has gone from a 12-month withdrawal plan based on a political solution with a residual troop force to help stabilize Iraq to a policy of immediate and complete withdrawal. Specifically, on (1) his support for Biden-Gelb, (2) residual troops, (3) a timeline for withdrawal, (4) diplomacy, (5) support for the war, and (6) funding of the troops, Richardson's positions have shifted dramatically since he launched his bid for the presidency.\n1. Richardson Voiced Support for Biden-Gelb NOW: Biden Plan Has \"Very Little Chance to Succeed.\" In a campaign press release, Richardson said, \"Senator Biden's plan to leave troops in Iraq means his plan has very little chance to succeed. The parties will not even sit down in a meaningful way until we get all the forces out. Senator Biden keeps drawing an analogy to Bosnia, but he has that one backwards: the peacekeepers could only enforce the peace after the deal was made. Using U.S. peacekeepers in Iraq would turn the guarantors into targets, thus plunging any settlement back into war.\" [Richardson for President Press Release, 10/12/07]\n\nAugust 2007: Richardson: \"Joe Biden's Plan Has Potential.\" At the Iowa Democratic Party/ABC This Week debate, Richardson said, \"[W]hat we are able now to do is force this negotiation, this reconciliation process, which I believe Joe Biden's plan has potential -- a possible partition or division of oil revenues, an all-Muslim peacekeeping force. Get Turkey, get Jordan, get Egypt. Talk to Iran and Syria. Bring them in. What is needed here is stability, and I think that all of these countries can be invested in a plan for stability.\" [Iowa Democratic Party/ABC This Week, 8/19/07]\nSeptember 2006: Richardson Said Biden-Gelb May Ultimately be the \"Right Solution.\" In September 2006, Bill Richardson, Governor of New Mexico said, \"I would also study Senator Biden's federation [proposal]. I think that may be ultimately the right solution.\" [Christian Science Monitor, 9/27/06]\n\n2. Richardson Previously Advocated Residual Troops\nNOW: Richardson Commercial Touts Plan to Pull \"Every Single Soldier\" Out of Iraq. In his most recent television commercial, Bill Richardson says Richardson has \"the only plan that pulls every single soldier out of Iraq.\" [Richardson Campaign Advertisement, \"Offers\"]\n\n\nOctober 2006: Leave Residual, Transitional Force … Bill Richardson said, \"You negotiate this timetable that is also, I think, responsibly supporting and representing our security interests in the region and not just leaving without some kind of residual force or some transition force.\" [MSNBC, Hardball, 10/9/06]\n  \n\nDecember 2006: Richardson Said Withdrawal Might Include a Residual Force. Gov. Richardson said, \"No, I'm talking about a fixed withdrawal date. I'm talking about a sizable withdrawal with perhaps a residual force—a very small residual force. But I think you have to fix the date, and you do it consulting with our military commanders, with the Iraqi government—and this is not 'cut and run'—what I'm proposing is something that I believe will work, a fixed withdrawal date.\" [Remarks to the New Hampshire Democratic Party State Central Committee, 12/16/06, emphasis added]\n  \n\nApril 2007: Leave Troops to Protect \"Other Vital American Institutions.\" Discussing his plan to withdraw troops from Iraq, Richardson said, \"I would not put them [the US troops] in Iraq, I believe I would leave Marine forces to protect our embassy and other vital American installations.\" [ABC, This Week, 4/15/07]\n  \n\n3. Richardson's Timeline is a Moving Target NOW: Richardson's Troops Withdrawal Timeline: \"Within A Year.\" During an event in Ottumwa, Iowa Bill Richardson said, \"Can we get these troops out within a year? The answer is yes. We moved 200,000 troops within three months at the beginning of this war,\" he said. \"I would put some troops, some, a very small number, in Kuwait. Nearby, with some contingencies. And in Afghanistan, where I do believe they are needed. We've done enough. It's time for Iraq to take over, for them to take responsibility.\" [Ottumwa Courier, 10/11/07]\nRichardson's Previous Positions:\n\nDecember 2006: Not Right Away… Asked if he would start pulling the troops out of Iraq \"right away,\" Bill Richardson said, \"No, not right away. I would look at our military commanders to fix a date that would be tied to a political solution.\" [CNN, Situation Room, 12/7/06]\nJanuary 2007: Must Be Tied To a Political Solution… Richardson said, \"I think we have to set a deadline this year or early next year I think it has to be soon that is tied to a political solution.\" [Associated Press, 1/14/07]\n\nApril 2007: Let The Military Decide. \"What I have said is that if I were president today, I believe a withdrawal could take place by the end of the year. I would let the military decide the timing and date of that withdrawal.\" [ABC, This Week, 4/15/07]\n  \nJuly 2007: Richardson Said \"I've Been Very Clear: Six Months.\" At the CNN/YouTube Debate, Gov. Richardson said, \"I've been very clear: Six month, but no residual forces.\" [CNN/YouTube Debate, 7/23/07]\n\n4. Richardson Argued for Diplomacy, Now Says Troop Withdrawal Must Come First\nNOW: Withdraw Troops Before Diplomacy. During the Dartmouth presidential Bill Richardson said, \"[Y]ou cannot start the reconciliation of Iraq, a political settlement, an all-Muslim peacekeeping force to deal with security and boundaries and possibly this issue of a separation, which is a plan that I do believe makes sense, until we get all our troops out, because they have become targets.\" [Democratic Debate, MSNBC, 9/26/07]\n\nApril 2006: Richardson Called for \"Strong Effort,\" \"Maximum Pressure\" for Settlement and THEN Withdrawal of Troops. In an April 2006 interview on CBS's Face the Nation, Richardson said, \"I believe what you need now is a very strong effort to get the three leaderships in Iraq, the Shiites, the Sunnis, the Kurds, to form a coalition government, put maximum pressure for them to do that, and then redeploy American forces to where we really have true national security threats.\" [CBS, Face the Nation, 4/16/06, emphasis added]\n\n5. Richardson Shifted from War Defender to Critic\nNOW: Richardson \"One Point Plan\" on Iraq is \"Get Out.\" At the YearlyKos presidential forum, Richardson said, \"I have a one-point plan to deal with Iraq. Get out. Get out. Get out.\" [YearlyKos Presidential Forum, 8/5/07]\n\n2005: Richardson Pledged to \"See this Mission Through.\" In his book, \"Between Worlds,\" Richardson said, \"At this point...we must see this mission through. We mustn't stay in Iraq past the point where the new government asks us to leave, but neither can we unilaterally pull out before the Iraqis have achieved control over their own internal security. We owe them the opportunity to make their democracy work. We must not undermine their efforts now.\" [Between Worlds by Bill Richardson, 2005.]\nFebruary 2003: Richardson Said he Would Have Voted to Authorize War In Iraq. Richardson said, \"My view is that it is critically important that the United States not let Saddam Hussein get away with this. Had I have been in the Congress I would have voted for the military resolution authorizing war.\" [CNN, Larry King Live, 2/14/03, emphasis added]\nNovember 2002: Richardson Said United States Has Justification to Take Military Action Outside United Nations. During an appearance on NBC, Richardson said, \"If the United Nations does not take aggressive action to back up the inspectors, to back up a finding, let's say, as you mentioned, of no-confidence, then I think the United States has justification to take military measures.\" [NBC, Saturday Today, 11/16/02]\n\n6. Richardson Promised to Fund the Troops, But Opposed 2007 Supplemental\nNOW: Richardson Would Have Voted Against Iraq Supplemental. During a May 27th appearance on Meet the Press, Richardson was asked, \"You would have voted against a[n Iraq funding] bill that did not have a fixed withdrawal date.\" Richardson replied, \"Yes.\" [NBC, Meet The Press, 5/27/07]\n\nFebruary 2007: Discussing Ending the War, Richardson Said he Wouldn't Want to \"Hurt the Existing Troops There.\" Asked if he was willing to \"start using the power of the purse, cut off the funding,\" Richardson said, \"Yes. That was the role of Congress. I was in Congress 15 years. The Congress should de-authorize the war. The way you do that is through appropriations. Now, you don't want to hurt the existing troops there, but some kind of legal instrument that binds the president not to expand the war.\" [CNN, The Situation Room, 2/2/07, emphasis added]\n\n",

    "text": "\n\nReaffirms Broad Bipartisan Support For New Way Forward In Iraq\n\nDes Moines, IA (October 12, 2007) - Today in Des Moines, Sen. Joe Biden was joined by Republican Sen. Sam Brownback as he discussed the Biden- Brownback-Boxer resolution that passed the United State Senate two weeks ago with overwhelming bipartisan support. The measure, which expressed support for a plan that would maintain a unified Iraq by decentralizing it and giving Iraqis more local control over their daily lives as provided for in the Iraqi constitution, passed 75-23, including 26 Republicans.\nToday's event, just as the recent Senate vote on the resolution signified, marks an historic bi-partisan agreement against the central tenet of the Bush administration's policy in Iraq - that Iraq can be governed by a strong, central government in Baghdad. For two years, Senator Biden has argued that Iraq could not be ruled from the center without the return of a dictator, a foreign occupation or internal genocide. Senator Biden and Leslie Gelb, Chairman Emeritus of the Council of Foreign Relations, published their plan for a federalized Iraq in the New York Times on May 1, 2006. Senator Biden has worked tirelessly for bi-partisan support for his plan since then.\nIn late 2006, Senator Biden began his opposition to President Bush's proposed surge of troops in Iraq by renewing his call for a federal system and arguing that President Bush would not change course unless he was abandoned by his own party. Senator Biden has a long history of building bi-partisan coalitions on such issues as the Violence Against Women Act and the Biden Crime Bill, which added federal funding for 100,000 new local police officers, and United Nations reform.\n\"I am proud to stand here today with Sen. Brownback and discuss the broad bipartisan support for a new way forward in Iraq that no longer clings to President Bush's failed policies,\" said Sen. Biden. \"The course this President has set for America's presence in Iraq has no end in sight. This plan offers a way to get our men and women in uniform out of Iraq without leaving chaos behind.\n\"Just as important, while we still have troops in the field, we must make every effort to ensure that they have the equipment they need to stay safe and do their jobs effectively. Going forward, I again urge all of the Democratic candidates to fund our troops as long as there is a single, solitary soldier still in Iraq. These soldiers have put their lives on the line and we owe them our support. But the President should not mistake our resolve in protecting our troops for a blank check to continue risking lives in the middle of Iraq's civil war,\" said Biden.\n\"Passage of Biden-Brownback-Boxer in the Senate is a historic step, but it is only the first step in pressuring the Bush-Cheney administration to change course and start withdrawing our troops responsibly. If the President does not end this war, I will. But, hopefully, with courageous Republicans like Sam Brownback stepping forward, we will bring America's involvement in Iraq to a speedier and responsible resolution,\" Biden concluded.\n",

    "text": "\nWilmington, DE (October 16, 2007) - Today, the Biden Campaign responded to Sen. John McCain's comments that the Biden Plan for Iraq will not work because \"Iraqis are Iraqis first.\"\n\"Iraqis once were 'Iraqis first' and we hope that someday they will be again but Senator McCain ignores the hard reality that they are not 'Iraqis first' now,\" said Biden for President Communications Director Larry Rasky. \"More than 90 percent of Iraqis voted for sectarian lists in the last election and they're also voting with their feet - some 4 million have fled their homes, mostly for fear of sectarian violence. Joe Biden's plan for a federal, decentralized Iraq - endorsed by 75 Senators, including 26 Republicans - offers the last best chance to keep Iraq together and to allow us to leave without leaving chaos behind. Sen. McCain remains wedded to the President's failed surge policy because he has no plan of his own.\"\nEven Petraeus Recognized That Local Control Works In Iraq. During his testimony to Congress, Gen. Petraeus noted, \"The most significant development in the past six months likely has been the increasing emergence of tribes and local citizens rejecting Al Qaeda and other extremists. This has, of course, been most visible in Anbar Province. A year ago the province was assessed as 'lost' politically. ... As this chart shows, other tribes have been inspired by the actions of those in Anbar and have volunteered to fight extremists as well. We have, in coordination with the Iraqi government's National Reconciliation Committee, been engaging these tribes and groups of local citizens who want to oppose extremists and to contribute to local security.\" [Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq, General David H.

    "text": "\n\nOne In Four Women Report Domestic Abuse During Their Lifetime\n\nDes Moines, IA (October 17, 2007): Today at Creative Visions, a human development nonprofit center in Des Moines, Sen. Joe Biden discussed his path-breaking plan to battle domestic violence. Despite the programs that exist currently to help those who are facing domestic abuse, including Sen. Biden's landmark Violence Against Women Act, there are many low-income domestic violence victims who need a lawyer but can't get one. Studies estimate that less than one in five low-income victims of domestic violence ever see a lawyer. Immediate legal help for domestic violence victims is key at the crucial moment when they reach out for help when they call a Hotline, walk into a courtroom or involve the police.\nTo help alleviate the demand for legal help, Sen. Biden introduced a plan to enlist, train and place 100,000 lawyers into the justice system to represent domestic violence victims. The National Domestic Violence Volunteer Attorney Network Act creates a new, electronic National Domestic Violence Attorney Network and Referral Project that will help facilitate the placement of these attorneys. In addition, the Act enlists the National Domestic Violence Hotline and various internet sources to provide legal referrals. Before kick-starting the national effort, the Justice Department will design pilot programs in five states to test the program. The Act also establishes a Domestic Violence Legal Advisory Task Force.\n\"It is our obligation to address the fact that nearly one in four women still report instances of domestic abuse during their lifetime,\" said Sen. Biden. \"The single, most important legislative accomplishment in my 32-year old career in the Senate was the passage of the Violence Against Women Act. But, we cannot stop there. In 2006 alone, more than 200,000 people called the National Domestic Violence Hotline seeking help and, after getting safety information, many wanted access to lawyers. We owe our mothers and daughters, friends and neighbors, access to legal help if they ever find themselves in a dangerous situation.\"\nSen. Biden led the fight to criminalize violence against women and to hold batterers truly accountable by writing the ground-breaking Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in the 1990s. It encouraged states to set up coordinated community responses to domestic violence and rape; spurred states to pass hundreds of laws prohibiting family violence; and provided resources to create shelters so battered women abused by husbands and boyfriends had a safe place to go. The law also established a national hotline for abused women that over 1.5 million have used for help. By training law enforcement and prosecutors to treat abuse like the crime it is by arresting and convicting abusive husbands instead of telling them to take a walk around the block, and by empowering women to make changes in their lives, domestic violence is down 50 percent and rape is down 60 percent nationwide.\nThe 100,000 Attorneys: \nThe National Domestic Violence Volunteer Attorney Network Act\nDomestic violence remains a reality for one out of four women in our country. Experts agree a key to ending domestic violence is meaningful access to the justice system. Often stopping the violence hinges on a victim's ability to obtain effective protection orders, initiate separation proceedings or design safe child custody. Yet thousands of victims of domestic violence go without representation every day in this country. At best, less than 1 out of 5 low-income victims ever see a lawyer.\nThere is a wealth of untapped resources in this country - lawyers who want to volunteer. Senator Biden's National Domestic Violence Volunteer Act would harness the skills, enthusiasm and dedication of these lawyers and infuse 100,000 new volunteer lawyers into the justice system to represent domestic violence victims. To enlist, train and place lawyers, the Act creates a new, electronic National Domestic Violence Attorney Network and Referral Project.\nThere are five components of the bill:\n1. Creates a National Domestic Violence Volunteer Attorney Network Referral Project to be managed by the American Bar Association Commission on Domestic Violence.\nWith $2 million of new federal funding each year, the American Bar Association Commission on Domestic Violence will solicit for volunteer lawyers and then create and maintain an electronic network. It will provide appropriate mentoring, training and technical assistance to volunteer lawyers. And it will establish and maintain a point of contact in each state - a statewide legal coordinator - to help match willing lawyers to victims.\n2. Enlists the National Domestic Violence Hotline and Internet sources to provide legal referrals.\nThe bill will authorize $500,000 of new federal spending to the National Domestic Violence Hotline to update their system and train advocates on how to provide legal referrals to callers in coordination with the American Bar Association Commission on Domestic Violence. Legal referrals may also be done by qualified Internet-based services.\n3. Creates a Pilot Program and National Rollout of National Domestic Violence Volunteer Attorney Network and Referral Project.\nThe bill designs a pilot program to implement the volunteer attorney network in five diverse states with $750,000 grants. The Office on Violence Against Women in the Department of Justice will administer these monies to qualified statewide legal coordinators to help them connect with the ABA Commission on Domestic Violence, the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and the volunteer lawyers.\nAfter a successful stint in five states, the bill will rollout the program nationally with annual appropriations of $8 million each year.\n4. Establishes a Domestic Violence Legal Advisory Task Force.\n5. Mandates the Government Accounting Office to study each state and assess the scope and quality of legal services available to battered women and report back to Congress within a year.\nAn excellent roundtable of groups reviewed and contributed to this legislation, including the National Network to End Domestic Violence, the Legal Resource Center for Violence Against Women, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, the American Bar Association, WomensLaw.org, the National Domestic Violence Hotline, the Legal Services Corporation, the American Prosecutors Research Institute, National Legal Aid and Defenders Association, National Center for State Courts, National Association for Attorneys General, Battered Women's Justice Project, National Association of Women Judges, National Association of Women Lawyers, National Crime Victim Bar Association and National Center for the Victims of Crime.\n",

    "text": "\nOCTOBER 18, 2007\nTO: INTERESTED PARTIES\nFROM: LUIS NAVARRO\nCAMPAIGN MANAGER, BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT\nRE: MOMENTUM\nWith 12 weeks to go, Sen. Biden's continuing leadership on the issues Americans care about most, including Iraq and restoring our place in the world, has created some real momentum in this presidential race.\nMany in the press are beginning to recognize our campaign's movement in Iowa and other early states. We've come a long way. As Des Moines Register columnist David Yepsen noted this week, \"Other candidates are showing more potential, some are fading. In Iowa, Joseph Biden's candidacy is being underestimated. His competency on foreign affairs is solid, and he gets good crowds. The Iowa Poll shows him gaining support, while Bill Richardson is slipping.\" Scot Lehigh of the Boston Globe noted a similar trend in Iowa: \"Further, Dave Nagle, a former Iowa congressman and erstwhile state party chairman, says Biden is emerging as the second choice among many Democrats, a good place to be in the caucus process. 'He is gaining traction,' says the neutral Nagle.'\"\nAt the same time, the campaign has been engaged in a concerted and successful effort to engage and ultimately win the support of key state legislators, who many agree can prove integral to a triumphant caucus strategy. Sen. Biden currently has the endorsement of 11 legislators in Iowa, a number that is barely bested only by Senators Clinton and Obama.\nThe Senator's unique plan for Iraq was endorsed by 75 Senators - including 26 Republicans. This recognition and support have helped him immeasurably on the campaign trail. Potential voters and supporters alike realize that America must come up with a way to leave Iraq without leaving chaos behind and Joe Biden is the only one with a detailed plan to achieve that objective. In fact, Gov. Richardson's South Carolina Co-Chairman, State Rep. Fletcher Smith, recently bolted from the Governor's campaign and endorsed Sen. Biden. \"I've had several members of my family, from my grandfather down to two of my siblings, serve proudly in our nation's military so it's especially important to me that we end this war in a way that keeps our troops safe and does not require us to send them back in the months or years ahead,\" said Smith.\nJoe Biden's message is breaking through. In the recent Des Moines Register poll, Joe Biden was one of only two candidates who saw an increased level of support among caucus goers. Joe Biden's experience and strength of character, as well as his mastery of foreign policy, has laid a solid foundation for the crucial months before us. As he continues to outline his domestic agenda in the coming weeks, we expect his support to grow as Americans better recognize his legislative experience on issues Americans care about, from battling domestic violence and putting 100,000 cops on the street, to defending the constitution and upholding the rule of law.\nAs he picks up momentum, Joe Biden is, as Dave Nagle said, becoming the second choice of many Hawkeye activists. As the Iowa Caucus and other early state contests grow nearer, we are confident that these voters will embrace Sen. Biden and realize that he is the candidate who can best counter traditional GOP attacks against Democrats on national security and crime. Because no one doubts that Joe Biden is ready to be Commander-in-Chief on day one.\n",

DSEA is the state affiliate of the 2.6 million member National Education Association.\nDSEA President Barbara Grogg announced the union's support for Senator following the unanimous vote of the DSEA's 25-member Executive Board on Monday evening.\nCrediting Sen. Biden as a national leader on issues affecting children and public education, Grogg noted that Biden has received the endorsement of the NEA each time he has run for U.S. Senate - a period spanning over 30 years.\n\"Sen. Biden's creative ideas and outstanding voting record as a United States Senator indicate the type of exemplary leadership he would bring to the Oval Office,\" Grogg stated. \"Moreover, he has demonstrated to the entire country that the priorities held near and dear to the American people, starting with education, can only be addressed if we extricate ourselves from the war in Iraq.\" \"My mother has an expression - 'Children tend to become that which you expect of them,\" said Senator Biden. \"I want a country where we expect much from America's children. Every child must graduate from high school. Every child should go on to higher education. Today, just two-thirds of students entering high school graduate, and about two-thirds of those go on to college. We are losing too many children in this country, wasting too much talent, leaving so much potential untapped.\"\n\"We know what we need to do,\" continued Biden. \"First, stop focusing just on test scores. Second, start education earlier. Third, pay educators more. Fourth, reduce class size. Fifth, make higher education affordable.\"\nGrogg added: \"We know that President Biden will bring the finest possible education policy advisor with him to the White House, Dr. Jill Biden. As a practicing public school educator, Jill Biden will provide firsthand insight and outstanding ideas based on years of successful educational practice.\"\nDSEA is a union of public school employees, professional and those providing educational support, whose mission is to advocate for the rights and interests of its members and bring about outstanding public education for all students.\n",

    "text": "\n\nStorm Lake (Iowa) Times: Biden Has \"All The Professional Skills\" And Personal Strength To Get The Job Done Unlike Any Other Candidate\"\n\nDes Moines, IA (October 20, 2007) - Today the Storm Lake Times endorsed Sen. Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination for president. Sen. Biden is the first Democrat nationally and in Iowa to have received a newspaper endorsement for president. The Storm Lake Times concluded, \"Biden is our choice for the nomination for the powerful personal story he shares, for his deep knowledge of international affairs, and for his long record of exemplary service in the United States Senate.\"\nBiden for President Campaign Manager Luis Navarro issued the following statement:\n\"This endorsement makes a powerful case for why Joe Biden is the person best prepared to become President on day one and reflects the growing support among Iowans who are coming to this conclusion after meeting all the candidates.\"\nThe Storm Lake Times\nOctober 20, 2007\nBiden for president\nWe have seen all the Democratic presidential candidates, except for two, up close and personal: Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Chris Dodd, John Edwards, Barack Obama and Bill Richardson. Biden is our choice for the nomination for the powerful personal story he shares, for his deep knowledge of international affairs, and for his long record of exemplary service in the United States Senate.\nDemocrats are fortunate to have such a strong and varied field of candidates. Every one of them we like — including Dennis Kucinich and Mike Gravel, who speak truth to power. Any one of them would make a tremendous president: Clinton by shattering the glass ceiling for women in politics, Obama for presenting a younger and different face to the world, Edwards for championing the cause of the little guy, Dodd for his long championing of those who suffer around the world, Richardson for his refreshing candor and good humor and wealth of experience as a diplomat.\nWe like Biden because he has been tried privately and publicly, and came out of it all a stronger man. His wife and young child were killed in an auto accident. He faced death with a brain aneurism but survived it. Anyone who has been through what he has gains a perspective that will serve him well in the most trying of jobs.\nBiden overcame severe stuttering as a child by memorizing and reciting the great Irish poets in front of a mirror. He continues to call them down at public appearances, Yeats and Heaney and Joyce, which holds a special charm for us and gives a glimpse into the man's soul.\nBiden is astounding with his sheer command of world politics and conflict. He has distinguished himself by offering the only workable plan to get us out of harm's way in Iraq. He advocates a loose federal system under which the Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds would each control their own territory, somewhat similar to the notion of American federalism. He would remove American troops to a safe distance in friendly environs — Kurdistan and Kuwait, to name two — and let the Iraqis solve their own problems. The Senate on a bipartisan vote recently endorsed the Biden-Brownback plan, which dovetails into the thinking of the most prescient politician on the issue, Rep. Jack Murtha, D-Penn., who led the charge against deeper involvement in Iraq that turned the 2006 Congressional elections.\nBiden is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Nobody, including the president, has a firmer grasp of international affairs. That's what we need right now: Someone who can restore the good name of the United States of America around the world, who can hold the torch lighting the way of liberty and human rights throughout the world. Biden is that man. He says his first order of business will be to shut down Guantanamo Bay prison and quit torturing people.\nAnd, we need someone who understands civil liberties here at home. Biden says that will be the theme of his inaugural address, if elected. You can't preach liberty abroad when you're spying without court orders on your own citizens.\nHow electable is Biden? How electable is a woman, or a man of color? Biden is somewhere south of 5% support among likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa. Remember that Jimmy Carter and John Kerry came out of nowhere. Polls can change quickly with such a small sample. The results are inevitable only if we place our bet with the big money and big machines. Biden has neither. He has a world view of America as an idea, a desire to restore our core values of freedom with shared responsibility, and a pragmatic view of foreign relations that seeks to bring nations together to find solutions short of misguided and ineffective wars.\nWe also find Biden to be a person of integrity. When he last ran for president 20 years ago, Biden lifted a line from a British politician's speech — whether conscious or not. Biden did not run and hide and deny and hedge. We recall it as if it were yesterday. In Davenport, he immediately admitted he was wrong, quit the race and thanked Iowans for their patience with him. We will never forget the classy way in which he ended that race. What appeared to be his major political foible is to us one of his strengths: humility, and a surprising lack of vanity. That's something we've been lacking with the current occupant of the White House.\nIt's hard to go wrong with any of the candidates. We stand with Joe Biden because he has all the professional skills and, more important, the personal strength to get the job done unlike any other candidate.\nHere is a link to the article: http://www.stormlake.com/bidenendorsement.htm\n",

    "text": "\nDes Moines, IA (October 23, 2007) - Today Sen. Joe Biden announced his health care plan for all Americans.\n\"I know what it is like to be wheeled into an emergency room, unsure if you'll see your family ever again - and I was lucky because I had health insurance,\" said Sen. Biden. \"All Americans should have access to health care and the principles that I have laid out today represent a gateway toward that very important goal.\n\"I pledge that during the first 90 days of my administration I will bring together groups on all sides of this debate and seize the historic opportunity we have before us to make heath care in this country both universal and affordable. The key will be tackling the four steps that will ultimately get us to universal coverage: covering all children, increasing access for adults, providing reinsurance for catastrophic cases and encouraging prevention and modernization in our health care system.\"\n\"Getting this done will require the kind of experience and leadership that comes from years of success corralling bipartisan support for numerous issues. I have that experience and it will prove invaluable when I am president.\"\nThe Biden CARE Plan: Four Practical Steps Toward Health Care For All\nJoe Biden's highest priorities - along with ending the war in Iraq - are universal health care and education. He will convene a national gathering of key health care stakeholders from labor, business, health care and government within the first 90 days of his administration to seize the historic opportunity created by the recognition from organizations ranging from Fortune 500 companies, the Business Roundtable and the AMA to the labor movement that the time has come for universal, affordable health care.\nJoe Biden's CARE plan proposes four essential steps to lay the foundation for universal health care:\n(1) Cover all Children\n(2) Access for Adults\n(3) Reinsurance For Catastrophic Cases\n(4) Encouraging Prevention and Modernization\nStep One: Cover All Children\nThe path to universal health care starts with making sure that the most vulnerable, our children, have health insurance. Today 9 million children are uninsured.\nJoe Biden would cover all kids by:\n\nExpanding the State Children's Health Insurance Program to at least 300 percent of the federal poverty level ($61,950 for a family of four).\n\nMore than 80 percent of uninsured children are in families below 300 percent of the poverty level[1]:\nUnder 100 Percent of FPL ($20,000) - 2.9 million or 31.8 percent\nBetween 100 and 199 percent of FPL ($40,000) - 2.9 million or 32.1 percent\nBetween 200 and 299 percent of FPL ($60,000) - 1.7 million or 18.4 percent\nOver 300 percent of FPL ($60,000+) - 1.6 million or 17.6 percent\n\n\n\n\nAllowing all families to buy into SCHIP with sliding scale premiums and co-payments based on family income.\n\n\nExtending coverage to at least age 21 (as states can choose to do in Medicaid)\n\n\nEmphasizing wellness and prevention by eliminating co-payments for physicals, vaccinations, vision and hearing screenings and preventive dental check-ups for children of any income level.\n\n\nAutomatically enrolling eligible uninsured children at birth, school registration or through other income-tested programs like WIC, reduced price school lunch or Head Start.\n\n\nExpanding Medicaid eligibility for some parents of low-income children.\n\nStep Two: Access for Adults\nWhile insuring all children must be our top priority, it is also important to offer uninsured adults access to health care. Building on the existing system, Joe Biden would open the doors to insurance for adults in three ways:\n(1) Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan Buy-In\n\nSenator Biden would allow uninsured Americans to buy into an insurance program that mirrors the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP) - the program that provides health insurance to members of Congress, their staff, and federal employees.\n\n\nWhile the program will contain the same carriers and the same plan offerings, the new program will have its own insurance pool. Carriers in the FEHBP program would have to offer plans in the universal buy-in plan, but would have access to reinsurance to help with catastrophic costs for enrollees with greater than usual health costs. The buy-in program could also have an age-adjusted \"payment\" or \"bonus\" for plans that enroll older and less healthy people to help carriers avoid the effects of adverse selection.\n\n\nPeople would be permitted to buy-in on a sliding scale based on income.\n\n\nSmall businesses would be allowed to participate in the program to help provide insurance for their employees. For companies that buy into the plan, employers, employees and the government would share the cost of the premium. Firms with a high proportion of low-wage workers would get a larger subsidy from the federal government than would firms with higher-wage workers.\n\n(2) Medicare Buy-In For People Aged 55-64\n\nThere are 29.5 million people between the ages of 55 and 64. Of those, an estimated 4.8 million are uninsured, 1.5 million purchase insurance through the individual market, and 2.7 million are early retirees that get insurance through their employers. Many people in this age group who are uninsured simply cannot afford to purchase insurance in the individual insurance market because of high premium costs due to their age and health history.\n\n\nJoe Biden will allow people between 55 and 64 to buy in to the Medicare program. Like the FEHBP buy-in proposal, the federal government will provide a subsidy for low-income individuals in this age group to afford to purchase early coverage in the Medicare program.\n\n\nWhile the federal government would invest money now to allow uninsured individuals between 55 and 64 to buy into Medicare, this proposal could save money for the Medicare program in the long run. By the time people become eligible for Medicare at age 65, many are already dealing with numerous chronic health conditions. Providing an earlier window to participate in Medicare can allow treatment of chronic diseases to start at an earlier age that can save Medicare costs in the long run. Only 59.3 percent of uninsured near-elderly manage to be able to see a doctor, compared to 87.7 percent and 84.2 percent of privately and publicly insured near-elderly respectively.[2] Giving the uninsured near-elderly the opportunity to enroll in Medicare at an earlier age can improve the number of people able to see a doctor and treat any medical conditions they have that would be more expensive to treat if they had to wait until they were 65 to enroll.\n\n(3) Reform The Insurance Industry\nInsurance companies often discriminate against people who need insurance the most -those with pre-existing conditions and those with high-risk factors for certain diseases. For individuals who do not have access to employer-sponsored insurance, the high cost of individual insurance policies simply forces them to go without health insurance.\nTo help people afford health insurance, Joe Biden would:\n\nAllow insurers that offer individual policies to access the reinsurance pool if they agree not to turn people away because of pre-existing conditions or risk of them.\n\n\nProtect against genetic discrimination by prohibiting employers and insurance companies from collecting or using genetic information when making decisions about hiring, providing health coverage, or discriminating in the pricing of an insurance policy.\n\nStep Three: Reinsurance For Catastrophic Cases\nMost Americans, 60 percent, receive health insurance through their employers. But employers are scaling back benefits as the cost of health insurance and health care rises. Millions of workers no longer receive insurance from employers - 70 percent of the uninsured are employed.\nAround 5 percent of people with the greatest health care costs account for half of health care spending in this country.[3] Just one employee with high medical expenses can push premiums up for all and make insurance unaffordable.\nThe top 1 percent of spenders - those with expenses above $50,000 a year -- account for 22 percent of health care spending.[4] In contrast, the 50 percent of the population with the lowest expenses accounted for only 3 percent of overall U.S. health care spending with annual expenses of $664 per person.\nThose in the top 5 percent of costs spend on average 17 times as much as the bottom 50 percent of spenders.[5] In addition, 57 percent of the top 5 spenders are under the age of 65: 18 percent between the ages of 55-64, 15 percent between 45-54, 10 percent between 35-44, 9 percent between 19-34 and 5 percent 18 and younger.[6]\nBy creating a federal reinsurance system for catastrophic costs, the risk and burden of covering these patients are spread among the general population, instead of smaller subgroups of employees.\nIn addition to helping families and business avoid financial disasters, a catastrophic coverage plan (often times called a stop-loss plan) can help lower administrative costs and reduce the variation in health care costs. Ken Thorpe, a professor at Emory University, has estimated that a stop-loss plan that pays 75 percent of claims above a catastrophic threshold would, on average, reduce the variance in claims costs by more than 50 percent. Reducing the risk factor for health plans would translate into lower health insurance premiums.\nProviding this type of coverage is not a new role for the federal government in the private insurance market. Indeed, the federal government currently assumes the risk for high-cost cases in several other private markets. For instance, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) plays a key role in providing financial assistance for the private sector (households and businesses) facing catastrophic losses.\nJoe Biden would stop the race to the bottom in providing health care benefits by:\n\nEstablishing a federal reinsurance pool to reimburse employers, insurers or associations (including voluntary employee benefit associations) for 75 percent of catastrophic health costs (those exceeding $50,000 per individual) for active and retired employees and their families.\n\nTo participate in the rebate program, employers would have to cover all employees and apply best practices to chronic disease management.\nPrivate insurers in the individual market would have to demonstrate that they operate an effective high cost case management system.\n\n\n\nStep Four: Encouraging Prevention and Modernization\nToo often the debate over health care centers around whether we're spending enough on health care in this country - when the reality is that the US spends more on medical services than any other developed nation, including those countries that provide health insurance for all.\nWe can afford to provide universal health care in this country - and we can help pay for it with a national agenda of sensible steps to get skyrocketing health care costs under control.\nThe U.S. spends over $2 trillion on medical care every year - approximately $6,697 per person.[7] Health care is 16 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).[8] Health insurance expenses are the fastest growing cost component for employers. Premiums have gone up 78 percent since 2001 - almost four times the rate of wages.[9] In 2007, the average annual premium increased by 6.1 percent.[10] Unless something changes dramatically, health insurance costs will overtake profits for many businesses by 2008. Yet we have no national agenda to address the affordable health care crisis. Joe Biden will begin to bring health care costs under control and increase quality of care by taking the following steps.\nFocusing on Prevention: According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), approximately 108 million people in the United States have at least one chronic disease. Including such diseases as heart disease, diabetes, asthma, hypertension, or osteoarthritis, these conditions have severe impact upon the quality of peoples' lives and health care costs.[11] Obesity, which increases risk for these conditions, has doubled among adults over the last two decades. It is estimated that 75 cents of every dollar spent on care in the United States is spent on patients with chronic diseases.[12] Treating chronic illnesses accounts for approximately 74 percent of private insurance spending and 83 percent of government spending.[13] But many adults and children don't receive adequate preventive care to manage these conditions before they result in costly complications. For example, according to AHRQ:\n\nApproximately 1.7 million hospitalizations occur annually for a heart attack or congestive heart failure, and over 600,000 people die each year of heart disease.\n\n\nNearly 50,000 people die each year as a result of diabetes, making it the sixth leading cause of death.\n\n\nHealth care costs for asthma patients rose dramatically from $4.5 billion in the 1980's to $10.7 billion in the 1990's.\n\n\nOver 50 million people suffer from high blood pressure (hypertension), which contributes to the incidence of stroke and heart disease.\n\n\nMore than half of people age 65 and over have evidence of osteoarthritis; it is the major cause of disability in this age group.\n\nIn fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 80 percent of type 2 diabetes, 80 percent of heart disease and strokes and 40 percent of cancer could be prevented if the American public would stop smoking, eat more nutritious foods and make physical exercise part of their daily routine.[14]\nSimply put, no health reform plan will be able to work without addressing the high costs associated with chronic disease. In order to contain health care costs associated with chronic diseases, Joe Biden would:\n\nIncrease funding for existing programs that promote awareness and prevention of chronic diseases and obesity.\n\n\nRequire insurers participating in federal programs to cover preventive care.\n\n\nEstablish chronic disease treatment programs in Medicare and other federal programs to better manage care, especially when a patient has multiple conditions.\n\n\nSupport research on the best approaches to coordinate chronic disease care.\n\n\nWaive copayment requirements under Medicare for screenings for cervical, breast and colon cancer, as well as other high cost chronic diseases.\n\nIncreasing Comparative Effectiveness Research: The US spends far more per capita on health care than any other industrialized nation; but the increased spending does not result in better health outcomes. In addition, the United States is the largest consumer of medical devices in the world.[15]\nOne of the challenges facing our health care system, especially with the aging of the population and the health care resources older Americans consume, is controlling the amount of money we pay for treatment. While it is tempting to control Medicare costs by simply reducing payments to providers, that approach does not address the issue of volume of services used— and also creates an access problem, as many providers drop out of publicly-run programs when reimbursement drops too low.\nOur current system reimburses providers on the volume of services used, without truly examining what services work best. We need to establish a mechanism to examine what methods work better than others.\nTo reduce ever-increasing health care costs Joe Biden will create a panel to compare the effectiveness of medical treatments and technologies. This could be housed in an existing federal agency like AHRQ, NIH or HRSA, or it can be an independent, public-private partnership receiving funding from both the federal government and private industry. Many other countries—including Australia, Canada, England, and Germany—already require clinical and economic assessments of medical services as a condition for reimbursement.\nTo take advantage of this potential, Joe Biden will:\n\nEstablish a Comparative Effectiveness Panel to: evaluate treatment protocols, medical devices and new technology and establish best practices for management of chronic diseases.\n\nInvesting In Information Technology: Joe Biden's home state, Delaware, is a leader in adopting new health information technology. The Delaware Health Information Network (DHIN) is a state-wide health information and electronic data interchange network for public and private use. With funding from both the federal and state government, DHIN is building a Clinical Information Exchange Utility to provide secure, fast, and reliable exchange of health information among the many health care providers treating patients throughout Delaware.\nThe potential for a significant improvement in the delivery of health care when healthcare providers and consumers have access to complete health and treatment histories is enormous:\n\nImproved quality of care: When a health provider or hospital has information about a patient's prescription medications, medical history, treatment history and allergies, he/she can make better clinical decisions, which result in better health outcomes for the patient.\n\n\nImproved patient-provider communication: When a patient has access to more information, he/she is more likely to engage his/her health care providers in communication about treatment options and wellness opportunities. As a result, the patient is more involved in treatment decisions, improving compliance and overall health outcomes.\n\n\nReduced duplication of services and treatments: Two of the most significant cost drivers in the health care industry are prescription drugs and high technology diagnostic and testing services, such as MRIs and CT scans. Compounding these costs is the potential for duplication of these treatments or tests. A quick check of an electronic medical record can show a provider the results of tests already performed and stop duplicative tests and procedures from being performed.\n\nThe potential savings to the health care industry from full adoption of electronic medical records is substantial. In fact, researchers at the RAND Corporation estimated that full adoption of electronic medical records could save $77 billion annually.[16] RAND also determined that by 2004, 15 to 20 percent of U.S. physician offices had adopted electronic medical records systems.\nTo get to 100 percent Joe Biden would:\n\nInvest at least $1 billion dollars per year in moving to electronic health records systems.\n\n\nProvide grants to states to develop electronic medical records and other health IT systems.\n\n\nAssist hospitals, medical facilities and doctors in upgrading to electronic record systems and implementing them in their practice.\n\nRequiring Uniform Billing and Claims: Administrative costs account for roughly 30 percent of all health care expenditures in the United States. One of the reasons for high administration costs are the numerous insurance claims forms that providers must fill out to get paid for their services. The State of Utah recently tackled this problem by getting all insurers and providers to use a standardized, electronic claim form designed to eliminate claim disputes and loads of paperwork. Every procedure on the form is listed the same way and patients no longer receive notices titled \"This is Not a Bill.\"\nWhen the Utah Health Information Network (UHIN) was created in 1994, health officials there estimated the state could save $100 million to $200 million per year by switching to a common system for medical billing. UHIN created a computer system that allows the many different billing systems used by doctors, insurers and hospitals to communicate with one another. But the network also required substantial cooperation from Utah's competing insurers. They agreed, for example, to cut a list of 900 codes for accepting or denying medical claims down to 90 and also agreed on common definitions.\nThe cost of health insurance has remained flat in Utah while it has increased an average of 13 percent per year in the rest of the United States. Several states are already studying what Utah was able to accomplish. Like federal investment in health information technology, the federal government should help states in their efforts to reduce administrative costs in medical billing.\nTo support the movement to a uniform billing system, Joe Biden will:\n\nProvide federal funding to support state initiatives to adopt Utah-like insurer agreements to create one claim form used by all insurers with a goal of moving to a uniform system on a national level.\n\n\nRequire insurers participating in federal programs to shift to \"paperless\" uniform billing and claims forms.\n\nNegotiating For Prescription Drugs: The Medicare Part D prescription drug program was created in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. Medicare covers more than 40 million seniors and disabled Americans who are projected to consume $1.8 trillion worth of prescription drugs over the next decade. However, instead of using the purchasing power of 40 million Americans to get the best prices possible for prescription drugs, the Medicare and Modernization Act of 2003 expressly forbids the federal government from interfering in drug negotiations between pharmaceutical companies and the numerous private insurers spread out across the country that offer Part D coverage. Simply put, this \"noninterference clause\" dilutes Medicare's bargaining position. The federal government successfully uses its bulk purchasing power to keep costs low in the Veterans Administration health system—why not allow it to do the same for our nation's seniors who rely on Medicare?\nIn order lower prescription drug prices in the Medicare Part D program, Joe Biden will:\n\nRemove the prohibition against the federal government negotiating prices for prescription drugs for enrollees in Medicare Part D to allow the federal government to use its bulk purchasing power to reduce costs for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nMeeting the Need For New Health Professionals\nNurses\nNurses play a critical role in this nation's health care system - they make the difference in the quality of care patients receive. With an estimated 2.9 million licensed registered and advanced practice registered nurses (RNs and APRNs), nurses represent the largest occupational group of health care workers and provide patient care in virtually all locations in which health care is delivered. Unfortunately, the US is in the midst of a nursing shortage that is expected to intensify as baby boomers age and the need for health care grows. Even the VA, the largest sole employer of RNs in the US, has a nursing vacancy rate of 10 percent. In the January/February 2007 issue of Health Affairs, Dr. David I. Auerbach and colleagues estimated that the U.S. shortage of RNs will increase to 340,000 by the year 2020 - three times larger than the size of the current shortage when it was at its peak.\nThere are several reasons for the nursing shortage. First, the nursing workforce is rapidly aging. The average age of the RN population in March 2004 was 47 years old. Second, the population of RNs is growing at a slower rate. Third, many nurses feel burdened by heavy patient loads, stressful working conditions and long hours and subsequently leave the nursing profession. Fourth, nursing schools are unable to educate more RNs at the rate they are needed. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing's (AACN), U.S. nursing schools turned away 42,866 qualified applicants in 2006 due to an insufficient number of faculty, clinical sites, classroom space, clinical preceptors, and budget constraints.\nJoe Biden will help train and put 100,000 new nurses in the workforce in the next five years by:\n\nIncreasing yearly loan amounts available in the Nurse Student Loan Program.\n\n\nExplicitly including accelerated degree nursing students—those who already have an undergraduate degree in another field who have gone back to school to get a degree in nursing—in the Nursing Student Loan Program.\n\n\nProviding funds for academic institutions to establish doctoral nursing degree programs in states that currently lack even one such program.\n\n\nEstablishing doctoral nursing consortia pilot projects to allow academic institutions to share faculty and other resources to better teach nursing students.\n\n\nEstablishing pilot projects between health facilities and academic institutions to allow nurses to stay in their jobs while also attending school to earn a graduate degree and eventually teach.\n\nPublic Health Workers\nPublic health officials are crucial in reacting to public health emergencies and they are critical to the safety of our communities. Joe Biden will help train the next generation of public health workers by:\n\nEstablishing the Public Health Workforce Scholarship Program to provide eligible students with scholarships to study public health.\n\n\nEstablishing the Public Health Workforce Loan Repayment program.\n\n\nCreating a catalogue to publish federal health employment opportunities.\n\nPhysicians\nPhysicians are the backbone of our health care system, and Joe Biden will continue to support the training of physicians by:\n\nContinuing support for Graduate Medical Education.\n\n\nSupporting initiatives to prepare physicians to practice in specialties to meet impending needs of Americans, especially geriatrics, family medicine and emergency care.\n\n____________________\n[1] U.S. Census Bureau: 2005 (revised), 2006 (revised), and 2007 Annual Social & Economic Supplement (ASEC) to the Current Population Survey (CPS); Census Bureau Estimates of Persons by Race/Ethnicity and State for Single Year of Age as of July 1, 2006.\n[2] Developing a Medicare Buy-In Program: A Position Paper of the American College of Physicians, 2006\n[3] Conwell LJ, Cohen JW.

    "text": "\nDes Moines, IA (October 25, 2007): Today U.S. Senator Joe Biden criticized his Republican rivals' health care plans, which would benefit insurance companies at the expense of seniors and low-income American families, in advance of the AARP \"Divided We Fail\" Republican debate in Sioux City, Iowa. Only two Republican candidates accepted invitations to participate in tonight's AARP forum, which will focus on health care and financial security for seniors. On Tuesday, Senator Biden unveiled his health care plan at Des Moines University and pledged to find a bipartisan path to universal and affordable health care within his first 90 days in office.\n\"Tonight you'll hear Republicans try to make the case that tax credits and health savings accounts (HSAs) will unlock access to health care for American families. But here's the truth. HSAs have high deductibles that families can't afford and require families to be able to put aside thousands of dollars to cover health care. Instead of supporting health care coverage for all Americans, Republicans continue to be more concerned with the bottom line for insurance companies and special interests.\"\n\"You'll also hear Republicans argue that the Democratic solution to our health care crisis will hurt business. But the truth is that Fortune 500 companies, the Business Roundtable, the AMA and the labor movement all agree that the time has come for universal, affordable health care. My CARE plan, which I laid out in Iowa earlier this week, would help businesses afford the cost of providing health insurance to employees by reducing the risks associated with catastrophic cases. I would do this by establishing a federal reinsurance pool to reimburse employers, insurers or associations (including voluntary employee benefit associations) for 75 percent of catastrophic health for active and retired employees and their families.\"\n\"With the right leadership we can find innovative and comprehensive solutions to our health care crisis that works for all Americans.\"\nTomorrow, Sen. Biden will participate in AARP's Divided We Fail Presidential Candidate Forum at The Puritan Conference Center in Manchester, New Hampshire.\nA fact sheet on Sen. Biden's health care plan can be found here.\n",

    "text": "\n\nQuestions Decisions By Sens. Clinton and Obama\n\nWilmington, DE (October 26, 2007) - Sen. Joe Biden today called for his Democratic opponents to unite behind a clear set of principles to prevent Bush and Cheney from leading the United States into another dangerous misadventure in Iran. Citing President Bush's recent allusion to \"World War III\" and Vice President Cheney's threatening comments last weekend, Sen. Biden criticized Senator Clinton for her vote to designate the entire Iranian Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist group, which could bolster Bush Administration efforts to justify military action against Iran. He also criticized Sen. Obama for attacking Sen. Clinton's vote after he missed the vote on Iran altogether. Sen. Biden voted against the amendment to the Defense Authorization Act last month.\n\"There's no question that Iran's leadership poses a challenge to us - especially the possibility they will get a nuclear weapon,\" said Sen. Biden. \"The question is, what's the smart thing to do about it? If anybody thinks you're going to stop Iran from getting the bomb by invading them or instigating an air war, they're mistaken. That would solidify every single Iranian - and they're divided right now with their leadership - in their opposition to us. It would get every Islamic state in the world further enraged about America. It would generate more danger and loss for American lives in Iraq.\n\"I voted against the amendment to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization because I don't trust this administration not to twist its words into a justification for war. Do you think this president abided by the spirit of the 1998 Iraqi Liberation Act? What did he use it for? He used it to justify taking down Saddam. Do you think he abided by the spirit of the legislation authorizing use of force in Iraq? He did not. He just leap-frogged over the conditions in the legislation to go to war. Do you think this President believes the Constitution places any limits on executive power? Now, you're telling me we can trust this President and this Vice President not to use legislation that declares roughly a third of the entire Iranian military a terrorist organization as a justification to use force against Iran?\"\n\"Unlike Sen. Clinton, I don't trust this administration to follow the plain meaning of the law. And unlike Sen. Obama, I believe this was a vitally important vote - not one to miss and then complain about later.\n\"Ratcheting up tension with Iran plays right into President Ahmadinejad's hands. It allows him to distract the Iranian people from the terrible failures of his leadership. And it keeps oil prices high, which just lines the pockets of Iran's government. It's hard to think of a more self-defeating policy.\n\"Democrats should unite behind an approach to Iran that is both tough and smart. We have to keep our eyes on the prize: preventing Iran from getting the bomb. The Bush administration spent five years obsessed with the idea of getting rid of the Iranian regime. None of us like the regime, but think about the total illogic of Bush's policy: renounce nuclear weapons and when you do, we'll try tot take you down anyway. Instead of regime change, we need a policy that promotes conduct change. The best way to do that is to make it very clear to Iran what it risks in terms of isolation if it continues to pursue nuclear weapons but also what it stands to gain if it does the right thing. And we have to keep our allies on board and make sure that Iran is the world's problem, not just our own.\n\"We must be engaged in aggressive international diplomacy at the same time we are tightening the economic sanctions against Iran. The American people must know that we will probably need to toughen up those sanctions - which will require some sacrifice here at home - before we can convince Iran to change courts. But these are sanctions necessary if we are going to avoid war.\n\"And most importantly, we need to accelerate the timetable for adopting my exit plan in Iraq. Because getting out of Iraq will allow us to focus on our efforts on the more dangerous threats coming out of Iran.\"\n",

    "text": "\nWilmington, DE (October 30, 2007) - Tonight in Philadelphia, candidates for the Democratic nomination for President will appear at the DNC/NBC News debate. Sen. Joe Biden issued the following statement:\n\"Tonight the American people will be looking for their next Commander-in-Chief. He or she will have to end the war in Iraq responsibly, because this President has no plan to end it. And, the next President will have to turn immediately to other hotspots, including Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to protect America's interests.\n\"We all agree that the Iraq war must end. But while leaving is necessary, it is not enough. We also need a plan for what we leave behind so that we do not trade a dictator for chaos. The Biden-Brownback plan for a political settlement in Iraq received 75 votes in the Senate, including 26 Republicans. In the meantime, we have more than a hundred thousand American troops risking their lives every day. We owe them our support as well as our gratitude, and that includes making sure that so long as they are there, they have the equipment to keep them safe, including mine-resistant vehicles. Some of my colleagues did not vote for that funding. That was a mistake. Some of those who will stand on the stage with me tonight also said that there might be troops in Iraq until 2013, the end of their first term as President. I ask them, 'how can you vote not to fund our troops when you acknowledge that they will still be in harms way years from today?' The safety of our troops is more important than election year strategy.\n\"The next President will also need to understand that many of the challenges we face are connected - you can't deal with one without having an impact on the others. For example, the next President will have to meet the challenge posed by Iran with smarts as well as strength and without further poisoning our relations with the rest of the Muslim world and, in particular, destabilizing Pakistan and Afghanistan. I voted against the Senate's amendment to designate Iran's entire Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization because I don't trust this administration not to twist this legislation into a justification for war - just like it did with Iraq. Democrats need to unite around an approach that is both tough and smart, not back legislation that plays right into President Ahmadinejad's hands by escalating tensions with Iran. That only serves to keep oil prices high - with the proceeds going right into the government's pockets - distracting Iranians from the terrible failures of Ahmadinejad's leadership and solidifying them against us, while doing nothing to prevent Iran from getting the bomb.\n\"For the next few months, the American people will be looking for a leader who can face these challenges head on from their first day in office.\"\n",

    "text": "\nWashington, DC - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) called on his colleagues today to support his legislation, the National Security with Justice Act (S. 1876), which among other things prohibits all United States personnel from engaging in waterboarding or any other form of torture. The full text of the letter is below and it was sent to all 99 other Senators this morning:\nDear Colleague,\nI write today to seek your support for legislation that prohibits United States personnel from engaging in water-boarding or any other form of torture. On July 25, 2007, I introduced S. 1876, the National Security with Justice Act, which among other things prohibits all United States personnel from using on a detainee any interrogation technique not expressly authorized by the Army Field Manual.\nAs the Washington Post noted this morning, it is sad that a nation with a longstanding, proud tradition of condemning torture finds itself embroiled in a debate regarding whether torture is legal. Both domestic law and international treaties clearly ban torture. Unfortunately, the current Administration's cramped, disingenuous arguments necessitate such a debate. Since 2002, the Department of Justice has consistently endorsed harsh and inhumane interrogation techniques that amount to torture. In July, the President issued an Executive Order that was notably silent on several such techniques, including water-boarding. And just last week, the President's nominee to be the next Attorney General, Judge Michael B. Mukasey, declined to answer clearly a question regarding whether water-boarding is torture and is therefore unconstitutional.\nThe United States cannot continue to equivocate and dissemble on this matter. When we countenance torture and other cruel and inhumane treatment of detainees, we diminish our ability to argue that the same techniques should not be used against our own troops. We need to send a clear message that torture, inhumane, and degrading treatment of detainees is unacceptable and is not permitted by U.S. law. Period. Therefore, Section 106 of my bill prohibits all officers and agents of the United States from using techniques of interrogation not authorized by and listed in the United States Army Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation. I urge you to support S. 1876 and join me in banning all United States personnel from engaging in torture.\nSincerely,\nJoseph R. Biden, Jr.\n",

In the spirit of Halloween, Rudy, if the dress fits, wear it.\"\nGiuliani on … Accomplishing our Goals in Iraq. Giuliani said, \"Maybe it's because I was Mayor of America's largest city and I was Mayor of America's largest city during periods of crisis. You know about September 11th. … So, to me, when I look at Iraq what I look to is, how well and how effectively are we keeping the civilian order functioning in the right way. Because ultimately that's going to be enormously important to whether we accomplish our goal in Iraq.\" [Giuliani's Remarks To The NATO Supreme Allied Command, 10/11/07]\nGiuliani on … Gun Control and the Second Amendment. In defending his previous support for lawsuits against gun manufacturers during remarks before the National Rifle Association, Giuliani said, \"I also think that there have been subsequent intervening events, September 11th, which cast somewhat of a different light on the Second Amendment and Second Amendment rights.\" [Giuliani Remarks to NRA \"Celebration of American Values\" Conference, 9/21/07]\nGiuliani on … Federal Funding for HIV/AIDS. When asked about federal funding for HIV treatment, Giuliani responded, \"My general experience has been that the federal government works best when it helps and assists and encourages and sets guidelines… on a state-by-state, locality-by-locality basis. It's no different from the way I look at homeland security. Maybe having been mayor of the city, I know that your first defense against terrorist attack is that local police station, or that local firehouse.\" [Iowa Independent, 7/20/07]\n",

    "text": "\nI've been saying for some time that Pakistan is the most complex country we deal with - and that a crisis was just waiting to happen. On Saturday night, it did.\nPresident Musharraf staged a coup against his own government. He suspended the constitution, imposed de-facto martial law, postponed elections indefinitely, and arrested hundreds of lawyers, journalists, and human rights activists. He took these steps the day after Secretary Rice and the commander of all American forces in the region appealed to Musharraf not to take them.\nAmerica has a huge stake in the outcome of this crisis - and in the path Pakistan follows in the months and years to come. Pakistan has strong democratic traditions and a large, moderate majority. But that moderate majority must have a voice in the system and an outlet with elections. If not, moderates may find that they have no choice but to make common cause with extremists, just as the Shah's opponents did in Iran three decades ago.\nBut unlike Iran, Pakistan already has nuclear weapons.\nIt is hard to imagine a greater nightmare for America than the world's second-largest Muslim nation becoming a failed state in fundamentalist hands, with an arsenal of nuclear weapons and a population larger than those of Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and North Korea combined.\nTo prevent that nightmare from becoming a reality, I believe we need to do three things:\nFirst, deal pro-actively with the current crisis.\nSecond, and for the longer term, move from a Musharraf policy to a Pakistan policy that gives the moderate majority a chance to succeed.\nAnd third, help create conditions in the region that maximize the chances of success, and minimize the prospects for failure.\nResolving the Crisis\nTo help defuse the current political crisis, we must be far more pro-active, not reactive and make it clear to Pakistan that actions have consequences. President Bush's first reaction was to call on President Musharraf to reverse course. Given the stakes, I thought it was important to actually call him - which is exactly what I did. I also spoke to opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. President Musharraf and I had a very direct and detailed discussion. I told him how critical it is that elections go forward as planned in January, that he follow through on his commitment to take off his uniform, and that he restore the rule of law to Pakistan.\nIt was clear to me that President Musharraf understands the consequences for his country and for relations with the United States if he does not return Pakistan to the path of democracy. Now, President Bush finally got around to calling Musharraf yesterday. As a few of you may know, I'm running for President and I can tell you this: if I'm elected, I won't wait five days to pick up the phone or delegate matters of this magnitude to my secretary of state or to my ambassador. There is too much at stake to leave this kind of conversation to others.\nIf President Musharraf does not restore his nation to the democratic path, U.S. military aid will be in great jeopardy. I would look hard at big-ticket weapons systems intended primarily to maintain the balance of power with India, not to combat the Taliban or Al Qaeda: hardware like F-16 jets and P-3 maritime surveillance aircraft. President Musharraf doesn't want this aid suspension - and neither does the military establishment whose support he needs. Nor can they afford for this crisis to undermine confidence in Pakistan's economy, which has already taken a hard hit. So I believe there is incentive for cooler heads in Pakistan to prevail. But if they don't and if President Bush does not act, Congress almost certainly will.\nBuilding a New Relationship\nBeyond the current crisis lurks a far deeper problem. The relationship between the U.S. and Pakistan is largely transactional — and this transaction isn't working for either party. From America's perspective, we've spent billions of dollars on a bet that Pakistan's government would take the fight to the Taliban and Al Qaeda while putting the country back on the path to democracy. It has done neither.\nFrom Pakistan's perspective, America is an unreliable ally that will abandon Pakistan the moment it's convenient to do so, and whose support has done little more than bolster unrepresentative rulers.\nIt is time for a new approach.\nWe've got to move from a transactional relationship -- the exchange of aid for services -- to the normal, functional relationship we enjoy with all of our other military allies and friendly nations. We've got to move from a policy concentrated on one man - President Musharraf - to a policy centered on an entire people… the people of Pakistan. Like any major policy shift, to gain long-term benefits we'll have to shoulder short term costs. But given the stakes, those costs are worth it.\nHere are the four elements of this new strategy.\nFirst, triple non-security aid, to $1.5 billion annually. For at least a decade. This aid would be unconditioned: it's our pledge to the Pakistani people. Instead of funding military hardware, it would build schools, clinics, and roads.\nSecond, condition security aid on performance. We should base our security aid on clear results. We're now spending well over $1 billion annually, and it's not clear we're getting our money's worth. I'd spend more if we get better returns—and less if we don't.\nThird, help Pakistan enjoy a \"democracy dividend.\" The first year of democratic rule should bring an additional $1 billion -- above the $1.5 billion non-security aid baseline. And I would tie future non-security aid -- again, above the guaranteed baseline -- to Pakistan's progress in developing democratic institutions and meeting good-governance norms.\nFourth, engage the Pakistani people, not just their rulers. This will involve everything from improved public diplomacy and educational exchanges to high impact projects that actually change people's lives.\nThis plan would fundamentally and positively shift the dynamic between the U.S. and Pakistan. Here's how:\nA drastic increase in non-security aid, guaranteed for a long period, would help persuade Pakistan's people that America is an all-weather friend… and Pakistan's leaders that America is a reliable ally. Pakistanis suspect our support is purely tactical. They point to the aid cut-off that followed the fall of the Soviet Union… to our refusal to deliver or refund purchased jets in the 1990s… and to our blossoming relationship with rival India. Many Pakistanis believe that the moment Osama bin Laden is gone, U.S. interest will go with him.\nWhen U.S. aid makes a real difference in people's lives, the results are powerful. In October 2005, after a devastating earthquake, American military helicopters delivering relief did far more to improve relations than any amount of arms sales or debt rescheduling. And the Mobile Army Surgery Hospital we left behind is a daily reminder that America cares.\nTo have a real impact on a nation of 165 million, we'll have to raise our spending dramatically. A baseline of $1.5 billion annually, for a decade, is a reasonable place to start. That might sound like a lot - but it's about what we spend every week in Iraq. Conditioning security aid— now about three-quarters of our package— would help push the Pakistani military to finally crush Al Qaeda and the Taliban.\nAid to the Pakistani people should be unconditioned — that is, not subject to the ups and downs of a particular government in Islamabad or Washington. But aid to the Pakistani military and intelligence service should be closely conditioned — that is, carefully calibrated to results. Like it or not, the Pakistani security services will remain vital players - and our best shot at finding Bin Laden and shutting down the Taliban. Their performance has been decidedly mixed: we've caught more terrorists in Pakistan than in any other country— but $10 billion later, Pakistan remains the central base of Al Qaeda operations. We must strike a much better bargain.\nA \"democracy dividend\" - additional assistance in the first year after democratic rule is restored -- would empower Pakistan's moderate mainstream. The Bush Administration's Musharraf First policy was understandable -- at first. Musharraf had broad support, and in the wake of 9/11 he seemed committed to the fight against Al Qaeda. Six years later, the General is diverting his military, his police, and his intelligence assets from the fight against the terrorists to a crackdown on his political opponents.\nThe Pakistani people have moved on. Hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets to protest Musharraf's unconstitutional rule— and hundreds have been killed or gravely injured in the process. The Democracy Dividend would help restore the moral currency this administration has squandered with empty rhetoric about democracy. And it would enable the secular, democratic, civilian political leaders to prove that they—more than the generals or the radical Islamists—can bring real improvement to the lives of their constituents.\nLast, we've got to engage the Pakistani people directly, and address issues important to them, not just to us. On Afghanistan, Iraq, the Palestinians, Kashmir, Pakistanis want a respectful hearing. We owe them that at least that much.\nAsk an ordinary Pakistani to list his top concerns about America and you may get answers unrelated to international grand strategy: our visa policy and textile quotas.\nOr she might raise Abu Ghraib and Gitmo or water-boarding and other forms of torture the Bush Administration still refuses to renounce. Pakistanis don't see these as mere \"issues.\" They see these things as a moral stain on the soul of our nation. In my judgment, so should we.\nCreating the Conditions for Success\nThis new Pakistan policy cannot succeed in isolation. Conditions in the region and in the broader Muslim world - conditions that the United States can affect - will make a huge difference, for good or for bad. We've got to connect the dots - to be, as I suggested at the outset, smart as well as strong. First, there's what we should do.\nTo increase the prospects that Pakistan will take the lead in the fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, we should rededicate ourselves to a forgotten war: Afghanistan. When we shifted resources away from Afghanistan to Iraq, Musharraf concluded the Taliban would rebound, so he cut a deal with them.\nRedoubling our efforts in Afghanistan - not just with more troops but with the right kind… and with a reconstruction effort that matches President Bush's Marshall Plan rhetoric… would embolden Pakistan's government to take a harder line on the Taliban and Al Qaeda.\nSecond, there's what we should not do. Consider all this talk of war with Iran. It is totally counter-productive to achieving our ends in Iran… but also in Pakistan. In Iran, it allows President Ahmadinejad to distract the Iranian people from the failures of his leadership… and adds a huge security premium to the price of oil, with the proceeds going from our consumers to Iran's government. And in Pakistan and also Afghanistan, anything the fuels the sense of an American crusade against Islam puts moderates on the defensive and empowers extremists. It is hard to think of a more self-defeating policy.\nHistory's Verdict\nHistory may describe today's Pakistan as a repeat of 1979 Iran or 2001 Afghanistan. Or history may write a very different story: that of Pakistan as a stable, democratic, secular Muslim state. Which future unfolds will be strongly influenced—if not determined— by the actions of the United States.\nI believe that Pakistan can be a bridge between the West and the global Islamic community. Most Pakistanis want a lasting friendship with America. They respect and admire our society. But they are mystified over what they see as our failure to live up to our ideals.\nThe current crisis in Pakistan is also an opportunity to start anew… to build a relationship between Pakistan and the United States upon which both our peoples can depend - and be proud.\n",

    "text": "\n\nAnnounces Reforms to Veterans Administration\n\nOnawa, IA (November 11, 2007) - Today, Sen. Joe Biden announced his plan to keep America's promise to veterans by reforming the Veterans Administration and making it more responsive to the needs of our veterans once they return home from the battlefield as well as our veterans who have already performed their service.\nSen. Biden believes that all veterans must have access to health care and that the Department of Veterans Affairs has a fundamental responsibility to address their varying care needs in a timely manner. His five-point plan for VA reform aims to improve the handling of claims, eliminate restrictions on veterans' access to health care, accommodate the long-term care needs of veterans, ensure adequate treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and improve the provision of care to all veterans.\nSen. Biden issued the following statement:\n\"This Veterans' Day we remember and celebrate the heroism and sacrifice of our nation's veterans. But we must do more than simply honor their service; we must keep our promise to provide them with quality care and services. The VA system must be fixed.\n\"We have veterans, not just from Iraq and Afghanistan, but from Vietnam and Korea, who wait nearly two years for disability checks. It takes, on average, 177 days for a VA regional office to process a claim, and it takes more than a year and a half to go through the appeals process. This is unacceptable.\n\"Our praise for these heroes must be matched by action. As President, I would make sure that the VA's handling of claims was improved dramatically, eliminate restrictions on veterans' access to health care, and accommodate the long-term care needs of veterans. In addition, I would ensure that there was adequate treatment of traumatic brain injuries, which have affected so many of our soldiers. My plan would create a presumption for TBI and PTSD that would allow soldiers to get treatment immediately instead of having to delay treatment because they have to prove their injury is related to their service. Finally, we need to improve the provision of care and make sure the transition from inpatient to outpatient care and from military to veteran status is seamless.\n\"In short, our commitment to those who have admirably served our country must be without question. Just as we must protect them and give them everything they need on the battlefield, we owe our brave soldiers the same support upon their return home. This is our sacred obligation.\"\nKeeping the Promise: Making the VA Work For Veterans\n\"Whether serving in peacetime or during conflict, our nation's veterans trained and worked long hours, often times spent long periods away from their families, and served loyally to defend our country. Our nation's democracy and freedom exist because of the achievements and sacrifices of our veterans. We owe them an immeasurable amount of gratitude and we have a solemn obligation to provide them with the support and care they have earned.\" -- Senator Joe Biden\nToo often veterans are not treated with the respect they have earned and deserve. Claims are not processed quickly enough - or are approached with skepticism. Joe Biden believes that the role of the Veterans Administration is advocate for veterans and ensure that they are getting the care they are owed. He will keep the promise we make to those who served this country and make the VA work for veterans by:\n1. Improving Handling of Claims\n2. Eliminating Restrictions on Veterans' Access to Health Care\n3. Accommodating the Long-Term Care Needs of Veterans\n4. Ensuring Adequate Treatment of TBI and PTSD\n5. Improving the Provision of Care for All Veterans\n\n1. Improve Handling of Claims\nThe backlog of pending claims and delays in the appeals process in the VA is simply unacceptable. Veterans wait an average of 177 days - almost six months - for benefits. The waiting period for appeals is over a year and a half - 650 days. To make the VA work better for veterans, Senator Biden would:\nSpeed up the claims process:\n• Establish a 100 day deadline for all claims to be resolved. If the claim is not resolved within 100 days, the veteran's claim is awarded at the level requested and the burden switches onto the VA to establish an accurate level.\n• Increase funding and staff of the VA to expedite the claims process.\n• Establish a lawyer corps to represent veterans free-of-charge during the adjudications process. Based on the JAG model, these lawyers would receive loan forgiveness and be paid a monthly stipend while agreeing to guide veterans and their families through the adjudication process.\n• Mandate Transition Assistance Program briefings for all soldiers transitioning from active duty to veterans status so that they are familiar with benefits they are eligible for and they know how to apply for them.\n• Provide VA raters access to readily available qualified health care experts who can provide advice and expertise during the claims process.\n\nStreamline the Discharge and Disability Rating System\n• Update the VA Rating Schedule over a period of five years, starting with mental health ratings.\n• Create specific ratings criteria for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical manual for Mental Disorders (DSM).\n• Building on the recommendations of the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors, provide periodic reviews of veterans' disability status to ensure proper compensation.\n• Revise the Physical Disability Evaluation System (PDES) by bringing it all under one command, creating injury specific PDES procedures, making it accessible entirely online.\n\nIncrease transparency:\n• Require the VA to publish the number of claims that are rejected each year in each region. This could help bring transparency to the claims process and explain variations in disability ratings in different areas of the country.\n• Establish a board to review disability determinations of service members separated between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2009, with a disability rating of 20% or less.\n\nCut down red tape:\n• Allow veterans with service-connected disabilities that are rated and certified by the VA to be eligible for SSDI benefits without having to be re-evaluated by the Social Security Administration (SSA) if they meet the other requirements for SSDI benefits. Currently, SSA evaluates all applicants (veterans and non-veterans) to determine their eligibility for SSDI benefits.\n• Allow survivors to step in and pursue undecided claims or those under appeal that were pending at the time of a veteran's death. This would prevent claims from having to start over again and delaying benefits for the surviving family members.\n\nGuarantee Funding:\n• Funding for veterans' care should be guaranteed. Instead of the budget for the VA being a discretionary item that can be cut, Senator Biden would make it mandatory.\n• Link benefits with cost-of-living increases.\n\n2. Eliminate Restrictions on Veterans' Access to Health Care\nAccording to a study conducted by Harvard Medical School, the number of uninsured veterans jumped to 1.8 million in 2004. Most uninsured veterans, like other uninsured Americans are in working families. Many earn too little to afford health insurance, but too much to qualify for free care under Medicaid or VA means testing.\nIn 2003, President Bush decided to exclude some veterans from accessing health services at VA facilities because of their income. It is estimated that many veterans who are excluded may have incomes as low $30,000 to $35,000 annually on average. Senator Biden believes that veterans - all veterans - are owed care and should not be restricted from accessing benefits. It is part of the contract the country makes with those who serve.\nSenator Biden would reduce the number of uninsured veterans by:\n• Ending the administrative freeze in access to care and means testing policies of the Bush administration. Allow currently ineligible Priority Group 8 veterans to access VA health services.\n• Enrolling any eligible veteran and ensuring proper funding for VA health facilities and providers.\n• Increasing outreach efforts to veterans so that they are aware of VA health services they may qualify for.\n\n3. Accommodate the Long-Term Care Needs of Veterans\nMore than 2 million veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will enter the VA system in the next 3 years - many with Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Advances in military medicine have greatly improved the ratio of soldiers surviving their wounds, but this also means that thousands will have multiple care needs and require health services from the VA for the remainder of their lives. The VA must have a plan in place to ensure they receive adequate care and support services. Senator Biden would:\n• Require the Department of Veterans Affairs to report on long-term care needs for the next 50 years.\n• Require the Department of Veterans Affairs to conduct a study of disabled veterans to obtain information about the ancillary benefits that these veterans and their families need most.\n• Allow specially adapted housing grants to be issued multiple times to accommodate changes in life circumstances and provide greater automotive adaptation benefits to more veterans.\n• Strengthen the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment program so more veterans can take advantage of this program to help them adjust to their new challenges and assist them with employment opportunities.\n• Extend eligibility for the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) to parent or non-spouse caregivers of severely disabled veterans and create a \"caregiver\" allowance.\n\n4. Ensure Adequate Treatment of TBI and PTSD\nSoldiers returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom are suffering traumatic brain injuries (TBI) at much higher rates than past wars and many also suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A recent study showed that between FY2003 and FY2007, about 60,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have been diagnosed with mental health issues.\nAccording to military mental health experts, if current trends continue, over 30 percent of soldiers in high combat situations in Iraq and Afghanistan and almost 50 percent of National Guard members will develop a mental health problem like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.\nThere is a crisis in the mental health treatment system that compounds these problems. There just aren't enough mental health practitioners to treat these soldiers - not to mention the stigma that is attached to seeking treatment which prevents people from seeking treatment in the first place.\nTo address the growing demand for TBI and PTSD services and other needs of our Armed Forces and veterans, Joe Biden would:\n• Strengthen case management for veterans with PTSD, including better coordination with vocational and other ancillary services, and provide reevaluations every 2-3 years.\n• Expand mental health services in the VA, especially the number of providers that have experience with treating PTSD or TBI.\n• Establish a protocol for pre-deployment assessment and documentation of cognitive function of members that can be used for comparison after deployment to assist in the diagnosis of TBI and PTSD.\n• Require the Secretary of Defense to establish two centers of excellence - one for TBI and one for PTSD - to develop the best treatment and screening practices.\n• Authorize the use of non-VA facilities for the implementation of rehabilitation and community reintegration plans for veterans with TBI, allowing veterans to get the care they need, wherever they live.\n• Establish a pilot program for assisted living services for veterans with TBI.\n\n5. Improve The Provision of Care for All Veterans\nWe owe our troops and veterans the highest quality care. The care our soldiers receive in the battlefield and in military hospitals is state-of-the-art and has saved countless lives. But we need to improve the transition from inpatient to outpatient care and the transition from military to veteran status. We can improve the communication methods between provider and patient as well as between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. To ensure that our veterans receive the proper provision of care Joe Biden would:\n• Direct the DOD/VA Interagency Program Office to develop and implement a joint electronic health record keeping system.\n• Increase the number of caseworkers and prevent the ratio of case managers to patients from exceeding 1 to 20.\n• Require that case managers be property trained in assisting their patients in navigating the VA system and provide them with the authority to advocate on behalf of their patients and their families.\n• Authorize medically retired service members to receive the active duty health care benefit for 3 years.\n• Require the creation of a single manual for outpatient care services, including information on the Physical Disability Evaluation System, family support, personnel processing and finance requirement, which is available online.\n\n",

Biden's Leadership\n\nWilmington, DE (November 14, 2007) - Two key African American leaders in South Carolina today pledged their support for Sen. Joe Biden's presidential campaign. Rev. Caeser Richburg and Rev. Dr. J.J. Jackson III both praised Sen. Biden's leadership during his thirty-plus years in the Senate and his strong record on civil rights.\n\"Sen. Biden is a man of tremendous faith and conviction and his distinguished record in the Senate reflects his core beliefs of equality and justice,\" said Rev. Richburg. \"His thoughtful and pragmatic leadership in the Senate and his ability to get things done and bring people together is what this country so desperately needs in a President.\"\nRev. Richburg is pastor of Williams Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Orangeburg. A native of Sumter, Richburg was appointed pastor of Williams Chapel AME Church in November 2006 following an 18-year tenure leading the congregation of Allen Temple AME Church in Greenville.\nRichburg is a member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Inc., the NAACP and the Board of Trustees of Allen University. He has also served as president of the Greenville chapter of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, past president of the Ministerial Alliance of Greenville and chairman of the Multicultural Advisory Board of Greenville Technical College.\n\"Joe Biden is a man with a deep understanding of the needs of working families in South Carolina and has the experience to bring about real change in America,\" said Rev. Jackson. \"I fully support Sen. Biden and his candidacy and know that he will once again restore credibility and bring the people's voice back to the White House.\"\nRev. Dr. Jackson is pastor of Israel Metropolitan CME Church in Greenville, South Carolina. A native of Birmingham, Alabama, Jackson holds a number of leadership roles in the Greenville communitiy and in South Carolina more generally. He is a Chartered Board Member of the Christian Ecumenical Fellowship, and Vice President and a member of Steering Committee of the RAINBOW Push Coalition in Greenville, SC, among other duties.\nBoth Revs. Richburg and Jackson were instrumental in pushing for the observance of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday as an officially recognized holiday in Greenville County. Greenville became the last of South Carolina's 46 counties to recognize King's birthday as an official holiday in 2006.\n\"Having the support of Rev. Richburg and Rev. Jackson is a big deal to me and I look forward to their advice and counsel in the months leading up to the January 26th South Carolina Democratic Presidential Primary,\" said Sen. Biden.\n",

    "text": "\nDes Moines, IA (November 19, 2007) - Yesterday former Sen. John Edwards and Sen. Hillary Clinton sparred over the need to be specific about how they will end the war in Iraq. Despite this back and forth, neither one of these candidates has a plan, that includes a political solution, which will end the war in Iraq.\nSen. Biden issued the following statement:\n\"I agree that we must be clear about where we stand on this issue, but the back and forth between Senator Edwards and Senator Clinton misses the point. Leaving Iraq is necessary but not enough - we need a plan to avoid leaving chaos behind. That requires a comprehensive political settlement in Iraq. Neither of them has offered a way to get there, but I have: the Biden-Gelb plan. Senator Edwards should say whether or not he supports my plan - as 75 Senators did last month and as more and more foreign policy experts and Iraqis now do. If he does not, what is his alternative? And Senator Clinton should follow up her vote for my plan by joining me in putting pressure on the Administration to adopt it.\"\n\"Politicking over Iraq will not help us convince the American people we're serious about an exit strategy that will protect our interests as we leave - and ensure that we do not have to send troops back to Iraq in a few years to clean up the mess.\n\"Some of the candidates continue to engage in irresponsible rhetoric about ending the war by cutting off funding, without acknowledging the reality that it will take at least a year to get all our troops out and that we must fund the equipment to protect them in the meantime. Others say they will have some troops there until 2013 but won't support the funding for Mine-Resistant Vehicles to keep them safe. Leadership requires the courage to lay out a plan and make the case for your solution, regardless of the political consequences.\"\nEdwards On Iraq\nEdwards Said American People Entitled to Specific Information on Iraq and Criticized Clinton for Not Providing a Plan. Appearing on CBS's Face the Nation, John Edwards said, \"I haven't heard a specific plan from Senator Clinton.

According to the New York Times', The Caucus, \"Today he [Edwards] also suggested that it might make sense to carve Iraq into autonomous Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish regions, but that Iraqis would have to make that decision for themselves. (Democratic presidential candidate Senator Joe Biden has long been a vocal advocate of such a plan. Mr. Biden is expected to visit Iraq this week.)\" [New York Times, The Caucus, 9/5/07]\nEdwards On Having Troops Out Of Iraq In 2013: \"I Cannot Make that Commitment.\" On withdrawing all troops from Iraq by 2013, Sen.

If I -- when I'm sworn into office come January of 2009, if there are in fact, as General Petraeus suggests, 100,000 American troops on the ground in Iraq, I will immediately draw down 40 (thousand) to 50,000 troops and, over the course of the next several months, continue to bring our combat troops out of Iraq until all of our combat troops are in fact out of Iraq.\" [Democratic Debate, MSNBC, 9/26/07]\n\n\nBut, Edwards Would Not Have Voted For FY 2007 Iraq Supplemental: Edwards Says Funding Bill Is Blank Check for Bush.

    "text": "\n\n\"If we don't change our policy, oil will further empower the countries that produce it, restrict our options, and undermine our economic and physical security.\"\n\nDes Moines, IA (November 20, 2007) - Today, Sen. Joe Biden announced his plan to reduce pressures that are causing the price of oil to skyrocket and to transform America into the source of the world's energy future. While the unveiling was originally scheduled to take place at a Kum and Go gas and convenience store that offers E85/Flex-Fuel - due to inclement weather, Sen. Biden outlined his plan from his Iowa campaign headquarters.\n\"We must begin to embrace - like Kum & Go and General Motors - innovation that reduces our dependence on oil, builds an export economy of clean technologies, and reverses the effects of climate change,\" said Sen. Biden.\nWith Flex-Fuel Vehicles (FFVs) as his backdrop, Sen. Biden said, \"We must fundamentally shift the way we consume energy in this country in every sector of the economy - from increasing fuel efficiency of vehicles and using alternative fuels to generating more power from renewable sources like the wind and the sun.\"\nBy raising fuel economy standards, increasing the amount of farm-grown fuel in the nation's fuel supply, mandating that every new vehicle built in the US be a flex-fuel vehicle and requiring large gas station chains to add alternative fuel pumps to at least half of their stations by 2017, Sen. Biden would substantially decrease our dependence on oil from unstable regions like the Middle East and cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than 100 million tons a year.\nHe called on the Administration to contain the rising security premium on oil by stopping its policy of ratcheting up tension with Iran.\n\"The price of every barrel of oil includes what the energy experts call a 'security premium' - an extra cost directly related to the risk of conflict - the more tensions rise, the higher the security premium goes,\" said Sen. Biden. \"We must stop the self-defeating saber-rattling when it comes to Iran. Instead, we should make clear our interest is not regime change but conduct change.\"\nSen. Biden announced a $50 billion investment in green jobs, alternative energy and energy efficiency. He also committed to setting higher energy efficiency and renewable energy targets for the federal government - the nation's largest energy consumer.\nSen. Biden pledged to restore US leadership on climate change by immediately directing US negotiators to return to global climate change negotiations and bringing with them a plan from the US to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.\n\"President Bush's refusal to do anything meaningful to reduce our dependence on oil or take action against climate change has insured that we are stuck paying the bill at the pump for his irresponsible foreign policy,\" said Sen. Biden. \"As the next president I will tackle our greatest challenge: undertaking the massive economy-wide project of transforming America into the source of the world's energy future.\"\nJoe Biden's Plan: Energy & Climate Security for America\n\"There is no question our oil dependence is threatening our national security. It helps fuel the fundamentalism we're fighting. Our oil dependence limits our options and our influence around the world, because oil rich countries pursuing policies we oppose can stand up to us, while oil dependent allies may be afraid to stand with us. If we don't change our policy, oil will further empower the countries that produce it, restrict our options, and undermine our economic and physical security.\" - Senator Joe Biden\nAfter ending the war in Iraq, a comprehensive energy and climate change policy should be our top national security priority. More than any other factor our oil dependence limits our options and influence around the world, insures that the price of oil remains high, and fuels the fundamentalism we are fighting. To restore our place in the world we must become an energy and environmental leader.\nThe United States spent $325 billion on imported oil last year - when the average price of a barrel of oil was $65 a barrel. This year, with oil prices at $90 - $100 a barrel, we will spend far more. Experts estimate that there is a $30 a barrel security premium because of instability in the Middle East. We pay more for gas because the price of oil now takes into consideration the extra risk -- that a new conflict in that part of the world will interrupt the supply of oil. This administration's saber rattling - its policy of ratcheting up tension with Iran - is counter productive and self-defeating. How the Untied States conducts its foreign policy directly impacts the prices we pay at the pump. And the profits go right into the coffers of the Iranian government and big oil. It's hard to think of a more self-defeating policy.\nGlobal competition over oil is going to intensify. The United States imports about 14 million of the 21 million barrels of oil we consume daily. We have less than 2 percent of the world's oil reserves. The extraordinary growth of China and India insures that demand in the world will outpace the discovery of new supplies. China alone is expected to add 120 million vehicles in the next 5 years. Unless we develop a realistic and effective energy policy our nation will become even more vulnerable to oil price increases, more dependent on oil imports and less able to pursue our national interests.\nClimate change poses a similar security threat. The Center for Naval Analysis recently concluded that we are only beginning to understand the threat that climate change poses. If temperatures rise 3-5 degrees, oceans could rise nearly 3 feet. By one estimate, 200 million people, in the coastal cities of New York, Tokyo, Cairo, and London, in low-lying countries such as Bangladesh and Indonesia, and in the islands of the Pacific and Caribbean, could be permanently displaced. Droughts and changes in resources in other parts of the world can also lead to conflict. For example, in Darfur farmers and nomads are fighting over land because of a drought. Unless we take steps to halt climate change we can expect to see a rise in regional conflict.\nJoe Biden would establish a comprehensive Energy and Climate Change Security Plan to transform the nation into a world leader on energy and climate change by:\n1. Establishing A Responsible Policy Toward Iran\n2. Restoring US Leadership On Climate Change\n3. Increasing Fuel Efficiency and Use of Renewable Fuels\n4. Investing In New Energy Technology\n5. Expanding Renewable Energy\n6. Requiring the Federal Government To Use Energy More Efficiently\n7. Encouraging Americans to Use Energy Efficiently\n8. Creating Green Jobs in the Technology of Tomorrow\n______________________________________________________________________\n1. Establish a Responsible Policy Toward Iran\nThe price of every barrel of oil includes what the energy experts call a \"security premium\" - an extra cost directly tied to tension and the risk of conflict, especially in the Middle East. The more tensions rise - including as a result of saber rattling rhetoric from the Bush administration - the higher the security premium goes. Right now, it is as much as $30 a barrel. Rising oil prices are fueling the regimes that are acting against our interests. In 2005, Iran made $47 billion off of exporting oil - double what it made in 2003 because oil prices had skyrocketed fueled in part by the rising security premium. OPEC as a whole took in nearly half a trillion dollars. The security premium only adds more to the hundreds of billions in \"hidden\" costs of imported oil. One estimate says that we spent $137 billion in oil-related defense expenditures in 2006 - about a quarter of the total. Joe Biden would reduce tension by:\n\nStopping self-defeating saber-rattling when it comes to Iran. Instead, we should make clear our interest is not regime change but conduct change.\n\n\nBuilding and sustaining an international coalition that makes clear to Iran everything it stands to lose if it pursues nuclear weapons - but also everything it stands to gain if it does not. The more we make Iran the world's problem, not just our own, the more we can keep tensions in check and meaningful pressure on Iran.\n\n2. Restore U.S. Leadership On Climate Change & Cap Greenhouse Emissions\nThere is scientific consensus that our climate is warming and human activity is driving it. Global warming not only has consequences for our environment, it poses a serious national security threat. We need to act at home to cap greenhouse gas emissions and lead the world towards a global solution. Joe Biden introduced his first climate change bill in 1986, to establish a national climate change plan, and to make climate change a top foreign policy priority. He would continue to make halting climate change a national priority by:\n\nReturning to global climate change negotiations. Joe Biden would immediately direct U.S. negotiators to return to global climate change negotiations, to seek binding commitments among all major emitting nations - including emerging nations such as China and India - to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to levels that prevent catastrophic global warming.\n\n\nCapping greenhouse gas emissions. Joe Biden would reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 by imposing a cap and trade system.\n\n\nBringing developing economies to the table. Joe Biden would use U.S. leadership to bring big developing countries, like China and India, into a global climate change treaty.\n\n\nProtecting vital habitat. Joe Biden would protect rainforests and vital ecosystems that absorb carbon dioxide by exchanging debt-for-nature. Deforestation accounts for as much as 25 percent of manmade greenhouse gas emissions and destroys one of nature's best carbon sequestration systems. Saving just one acre of forest keeps 400 tons of carbon dioxide out of the air. Joe Biden is the original author of a plan that provides debt relief to developing nations in exchange for protecting tropical rainforests that are critical to regulating the global climate. These Debt-For-Nature swaps have generated over $300 million in conservation funding that goes directly to protecting vulnerable and valuable rainforests.\n\n3. Increase Fuel Efficiency and Use of Renewable Fuels\nMost of the oil we consume - 68 percent ─ is used in transportation. Oil is 96 percent of the transportation sector fuel supply. More than 20 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions come from passenger vehicles. Increasing the use and availability of alternative fuels is critical. Americans should have a choice. Joe Biden would substantially decrease our dependence on oil from the unstable regions like the Middle East and cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than 100 million tons a year by:\n\nRaising Fuel Economy Standards By 1 Mile Per Gallon Each Year: Instead of focusing on a fleetwide average, Joe Biden would advance fuel economy by upgrading to a better system that combines assistance for U.S. automobile manufacturing jobs with predictable increases in fuel efficiency standards for cars, SUVs and light trucks. The new system would set fuel economy standards based on the attributes of a vehicle (such as its size and weight). Instead of combining cars and trucks and imposing fleetwide averages, individualized fuel economy targets that increase by 4 percent per year (or approximately 1 mile per gallon each year) would be set for vehicles. Under this system fuel economy would increase from an average of 27.5 mpg to 40 mpg by 2017. Improving fuel economy by just one mile a gallon a year will save approximately the same amount of oil we import from Saudi Arabia and will cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than 100 million tons a year.\n\n\nInvesting in the Next Generation Technology: The market for lithium ion batteries - those needed for the next generation of plug-in hybrids which can get up to 100 miles per gallon - is dominated by foreign competitors like the Japanese, Koreans and Chinese. That is because these countries have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in developing and supporting the technology. Joe Biden believes the United States needs to make an equal investment in new technology like lithium ion batteries. He has proposed legislation that would double the investment in the development of advanced lithium ion batteries needed for plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles - increasing it from $42 million to $100 million a year for five years.\n\n\nRequiring New Vehicles Be Flex-Fuel Vehicles: Joe Biden would require all cars marketed in the US be capable of running on E85/flex fuel or regular gasoline by 2017 - a cost estimated to be just $100 per car. Joe Biden would direct automakers to gradually increase flex-fuel vehicle (FFV) production, increasing ten percentage-point increments annually, until nearly all vehicles sold in the U.S. are flex fuel vehicles within 10 years. At this rate half of all vehicles sold in the US would be flex fuel vehicles in five years. Currently, flex-fuel vehicles -- those able to use both regular gasoline and blends of up to 85 percent ethanol (E85) - make up only about two percent of vehicles on the road today (5 million).\n\n\nRequiring Large Gas Station Chains To Sell Alternative Fuels: Only around 1,300 of the 140,000 gas stations nationwide offer E85 or alternative fuels to customers. Major oil companies (those that own 4,500 stations or more) should offer alternative refueling capability at 50 percent of the stations they own by 2017. Joe Biden would require large chains to install E85 pumps at their stations, increasing by five percent annually over the next 10 years.\n\n\nIncreasing The Amount of Farm-Grown Fuel In Our Fuel Supply: Joe Biden would increase the amount of ethanol and biodiesel included in the nation's fuel supply by extending and increasing the current Renewable Fuel Standard and setting standards for biodiesel. Currently the Renewable Fuel Standard sets a benchmark of 7.5 billion gallons by 2012 - a fraction of the overall U.S. gasoline consumption which is 140 billion gallons per year. Joe Biden would increase the benchmarks to: 10 billion gallons by 2010; 30 billion gallons by 2020; 60 billion gallons by 2030.\n\n\nHelping American Manufacturers: We must help domestic automobile manufacturers meet new standards. Joe Biden's plan to reform the fuel economy system includes incentives to support domestic automobile manufacturing and the purchase of efficient vehicles. He would provide new incentives to vehicle manufacturers and parts suppliers to retool for the future by giving them credit for investments to re-equip, expand, or establish manufacturing facilities that produce advanced technology motor vehicles or components and for certain engineering, research and development, and employee training.\n\n4. Invest in New Energy Technology\nThe United States should lead the world in innovation and clean energy technology. Our energy security and our economic future require that we have the domestic resources to research, develop, and bring to market the clean energy the world will need. Over the past five years the federal investment in research and development remained flat. Basic research is the backbone of our economy. Yet over the 25 years from FY 1978 to FY 2004, government spending on energy research and development fell from $6 billion to $1.8 billion. We should be exporting technology instead of importing the parts to build biofuel plants from India or solar panels from Spain. To create jobs, boost spending on alternative energy, climate research, carbon capture and sequestration, and energy efficiency Joe Biden would:\n\nCreate A Five-year, $50 billion Apollo Project For Energy and Climate Change: Joe Biden supports more than $50 billion in new incentives for research into: alternative fuel and energy sources, renewable energy technology, nuclear waste management and safety, and carbon capture and sequestration technologies that could allow us to use coal cleanly. Programs would include financial prizes awarded for breakthroughs in specific technologies; additional funds for an \"Energy ARPA,\" a successful decentralized, high risk- high reward research model; demonstration and test projects designed to jump-start commercial implementation; and additional funding for critical technologies.\n\nJoe Biden would pay for the Apollo Project by:\n\nTaxing Oil Company Windfall Profits: In 2006, ExxonMobil made a profit of $40 billion, the largest profit ever recorded by an American company. Joe Biden would impose a windfall profits tax that would go directly into the Apollo Project when oil companies post record profits from skyrocketing oil prices.\n\n\nRepealing Unnecessary Tax Breaks For Big Oil Companies: In 2006, Joe Biden asked several oil executives point-blank whether they needed $2.6 billion in tax breaks they were given in 2005. They said no. Joe Biden would take back these tax giveaways the oil companies didn't even ask for and have testified they do not need.\n\n\nAuctioning Carbon Credits: Auctioning carbon credits in a cap-and-trade climate system would provide even more funding for the research and development needed to put us on course to be a leader in the energy of tomorrow.\n\n\nCollecting Royalties For Production of Oil and Gas on the Outer Continental Shelf: According to the GAO, as much as $60 billion in royalties could go uncollected thanks to court ruling that oil companies do not have to pay royalties for oil production on the federally controlled Outer Continental Shelf. Joe Biden would require oil companies to pay their fair share as Congress originally intended.\n\n\nPreventing Price Gouging: Joe Biden has consistently fought against price-gouging by the oil companies. He would empower the President to declare a temporary energy emergency like many governors did after Hurricane Katrina to ensure secure and reasonably priced fuel. He would also ban manipulative practices in oil pricing.\n\n5. Expand Use Of Renewable Energy\nWe can meet a much greater share of the nation's energy demand through renewable resources like wind, solar, biomass and geothermal. A quarter of the country has winds strong enough to generate electricity -- seven states in the Southwest alone have the potential to provide 10 times the current electric generating capacity through solar power. But just 2.3 percent of our power comes from these sources today. To meet the nation's growing demand for energy we must use more renewable resources. Joe Biden would increase use of renewable energy by:\n\nEstablishing a National Renewable Electricity Standard. Joe Biden would set a national Renewable Electricity Standard of 20 percent to require that at least one-fifth of the country's electricity comes from clean, renewable sources like wind, solar, biomass and geothermal.\n\n6. Require the Federal Government To Be More Energy Efficient\nThe US government is the country's largest energy consumer. Joe Biden would save taxpayers money - almost $4 billion dollars - and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by millions of tons by requiring the government to be more energy efficient. He would:\n\nEstablish Energy Efficiency and Renewable Resources As A National Priority: Joe Biden would require every government agency to become more energy efficient and insure that energy efficiency and use of renewable resources was priority for all government projects.\n\n\nSet Renewable Energy Requirements. Joe Biden would require the federal government to purchase 10 percent renewable electricity by 2010 and 20 percent by the end of the next decade.\n\n\nMake Federal Buildings More Efficient. Joe Biden would increase federal building energy efficiency by requiring a 30 percent reduction in energy use over the next ten years. He would also require that all lighting in federal buildings be Energy Star products that save energy and money over their lifetimes.\n\n\nImprove Federal Fuel Efficiency. Joe Biden would use the federal government to drive the market. He supports requiring that federal agencies use 20 percent less gasoline by 2015 than they did in 2005 - and 10 percent more alternative fuels every year.\n\n\nSupport Military Efforts to Improve Energy Efficiency: The military is the biggest consumer of energy in the federal government. Joe Biden supports extending and expanding the Pentagon's ongoing efforts to improve its energy efficiency. By making bases energy independent, developing more efficient vehicles, and finding new sources of sustainable and deliverable energy, our military can continue to lead in implementing new technologies to keep our energy future secure.\n\n7. Encourage Americans To Use Energy Efficiently\nAmerican families use about 1.4 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year. We spend approximately $130 billion a year on electricity. Energy efficient technology can save electricity and money. Using energy more efficiently is crucial to reducing US electricity demand which is projected to grow by more than 30 percent by 2025.\nSmall things - like switching to highly efficient light bulbs - can make a big difference if everyone starts to make a change. Compact florescent light bulbs (CFLs) use only a quarter the energy of a regular bulb. One switch from incandescent bulbs to CFLs can save about 1000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions over the lifetime of the bulb. If every family across the US replaces just one regular incandescent bulb with a CFL, we can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 7 million tons per year.\n\nFlip To Efficient Technologies. Joe Biden would create the Flip-to-Save program to provide $50 million in funding to states to administer programs to educate consumers on efficient technology and distribute highly efficient compact florescent light bulbs which use a quarter of the energy of regular bulbs.\n\n\nIncrease Use of Energy Efficient Appliances. Joe Biden would expand the \"Energy Star Program\" to include standards for more appliances and commercial systems.\n\n\nSupport Green Building Codes. Joe Biden would support local updates to building codes to capture cost-effective energy efficiency opportunities in new residential/commercial construction\n\n\nCreate Incentives To Go Green. Joe Biden supports increasing incentives for energy efficient commercial buildings and manufacturing sector.\n\n8. Create Green Jobs in the Technology of Tomorrow\nJoe Biden would take action to ensure that America's workers will be the best trained and best prepared for tomorrow's energy economy, not a relic of the past. There is no doubt that we will use energy very differently in the future than we do today. This is a golden opportunity for America to lead the world in developing new technologies.\n\n\"Green Jobs\" Training: Joe Biden supports investing $100 million to train American workers in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries. This would provide a core of 30,000 skilled workers to ensure American energy development doesn't suffer from a lack of trained specialists.\n\n\nCreating Jobs Through Increasing Use of Renewable Energy: Renewable energy and energy efficiency already account for over 8 million jobs in the United States. A Renewable Electricity Standard could add another 200,000 jobs by 2020.\n\n\nPreparing America's Economy For The Future: In a world where everyone will be buying new energy technologies, America must be prepared to sell them to stay competitive. We could save consumers $50 billion in 2020 through fuel economy improvements and a Renewable Electricity Standard. . This would also put $25 billion dollars into the pockets of farmers, ranchers, and other rural landowners who could use their land to produce clean power.\n\n\nFunding Research: Joe Biden's Apollo program would create the next generation of scientists and engineers promote the innovation and openness to ideas that has been America's historical strength.\n\n",

Many of these Americans are expected to face delays and other problems. During peak holiday times over the summer delays were the worst on record.\nSen. Joe Biden today promised to tackle the toughest air travel issues during his first year in office, in an effort to make flying easier, more convenient and safer. Passengers should be made aware of their rights and more information should be provided to them regarding customer service.\nSen. Biden issued the following statement:\n\"Five years after the 9/11, more Americans than ever are traveling in our skies. However, because we have not modernized our air travel infrastructure, passengers still face delays and other problems on a daily basis. These troubles are compounded at peak times around holidays like this week.\n\"Overhauling our air travel infrastructure and improving passenger safety will be a priority during my first year in office. I will work with industry leaders, union representatives and passenger advocacy groups to modernize air traffic control and air space management, to improve consumer safety, and expand protections and rights for passengers.\n\"We must craft long-term solutions, not just patch together stop-gap measures like President Bush's decision last week to temporarily allow commercial planes to operate in military airspace during this upcoming holiday.\"\nJoe Biden would:\n\nRequire carriers to provide food, water, and restroom facilities to passengers during delays - or give them the option to deplane.\n\n\nRequire carriers to publish customer service policies and post information about chronically delayed flights.\n\n\nExpand inspections of health and safety conditions on planes.\n\n\nUrge the air traffic controllers' union and the FAA to return to negotiations to provide incentives for controllers to postpone retirement and keep the US system moving. A record number of veteran air traffic controllers left the FAA last year - we cannot afford to lose the expertise of experienced controllers.\n\n\nAsk National Academy of Sciences to conduct an independent study of air traffic control staffing needs.\n\n\nCreate an interagency task force (including Department of Defense and Federal Aviation Administration) to speed the implementation of the Next Generation Air Traffic Control system which will use satellites and advanced communications to improve management of the nation's crowded air space and develop a national Air Traffic Congestion Management Plan to alleviate highly congested corridors.\n\n\nInvest in airport infrastructure and modernization to build new runways and increase capacity of our nation's airports.\n\n\nRequire DOT to review and update carrier compliance with overbooking regulations.\n\n\nCreate an Aviation Consumer Protection Commission and expand DOT investigative authority into consumer complaints regarding cancellations, overbooking, lost baggage and overcharges.\n\n\nEstablish a national Travelers Complaint Hotline.\n\n",

Biden issued the following statement on the news that former White House press secretary Scott McClellan writes \"in his new book that the White House intentionally misled him concerning the CIA leak case and that President Bush was involved in his passing along 'false information' to the press.\" [Foxnews.com, 11/20/07]\n\"The President should immediately come forward and explain any action taken by him or his administration to mislead the American public. The American people deserve the truth,\" said Sen. Biden.\n\"President Bush himself said that he would take action against anyone who leaked the name of an American agent. Far from punishing anyone, it appears from McClellan's account that the President himself was \"involved\" in spreading false information. That is outrageous.\n\"These allegations give me little confidence in the Bush Administration's current aggressive posture towards Iran that is escalating tensions. This is why I voted against the Kyl-Lieberman amendment to designate part of Iran's military a terrorist organization. It is the same reason why the American people have lost all confidence in the President and why I told Secretary Rice during hearings before my committee that I would myself initiate impeachment hearings if the President acts irresponsibly on the use of force against Iran.\"\nGeorge H. W. Bush Called Those Who Expose the Name of CIA Sources \"The Most Insidious of Traitors.\" Speaking at the opening of the George Bush Center for Intelligence, George H. W.

They are, in my view, the most insidious of traitors.\" [Associated Press, 4/26/99]\nBush Said That If There Were Leaks In His Administration They Would Be \"Taken Care Of.\" Bush said that \". . .if there's a leak out of the administration, I want to know who it is.

    "text": "\nClarion, IA (November 26, 2007): Speaking in Iowa today, Sen. Joe Biden issued the following statement on Republican efforts to defend President Bush's surge strategy. He emphasized the continued need for a political solution in Iraq:\n\"Yesterday's attempt by John McCain and Rudy Giuliani to defend the Bush-Cheney troop surge in Iraq totally misses the point - and is misleading to the American people. Security in Iraq is better, thanks in no small measure to our troops. But there is no evidence - none - that the surge is succeeding in achieving its stated objective: to allow Iraqis to come together politically. There is no chance it will succeed so long as the Bush administration sticks to its failed strategy of trying to build a strong central government in Baghdad that wins the support of all Iraqis. There is no trust within the central government, no trust of the government by the people and no capacity on the part of the government to deliver basic security and services. Absent an occupation we cannot sustain or the return of a dictator we cannot want, Iraq cannot be governed from the center at this point in its history.\n\"There's only one possible path to a durable political settlement in Iraq and it's the one I proposed and that 74 other Senators endorsed: decentralize power and give Iraqis local control over their daily lives. The administration has a huge opportunity to use this relative decrease in violence to abandon the failed policy of strong central government and to bring the international community into the effort to push for a federal system, while starting to draw down our combat forces. But, President Bush and his supporters remain wedded to his failed strategy, which is prolonging the war and the bloodshed, with no end in sight. They are using American soldiers to keep a lid on the violence, but they lack a political plan to prevent chaos from returning as soon as our forces leave. This \"stop gap strategy\" means that more American lives will be lost, more American treasure will be spent and more harm will be done to our military without any chance for lasting success. That is unconscionable.\n\"The overwhelming majority of Americans believe we should leave Iraq without leaving chaos behind. The administration and its supporters have no strategy to achieve that objective. I do.\n\"Until we solve the problems in Iraq, the United States will have absolutely no credibility to solve problems that pose even greater threats around the world. Successfully dealing with Iraq will help restore America's global leadership.\"\nNew York Times: Troop Surge Intended to Improve Political Stability, But Benchmarks Remain Unfulfilled. The New York Times reported, \"With American military successes outpacing political gains in Iraq, the Bush administration has lowered its expectation of quickly achieving major steps toward unifying the country, including passage of a long-stymied plan to share oil revenues and holding regional elections. … 'If we can show progress outside of the security sector alone, that will go a long way to demonstrate that we are in fact on a sustainable path to stability in Iraq,' the senior official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. … The troop increase at the beginning of the year was intended to create the conditions to improve Iraq's political stability, measured by so-called benchmarks, including a broad agreement on sharing oil revenues. But those benchmarks remain largely unfulfilled.\" [New York Times, 11/25/07]\nBush: \"A Successful Strategy for Iraq Goes Beyond Military Operations.\" In a January 2007 address to the nation introducing the surge policy, Bush said, \"Most of Iraq's Sunni and Shi'a want to live together in peace, and reducing the violence in Baghdad will help make reconciliation possible. A successful strategy for Iraq goes beyond military operations. Ordinary Iraqi citizens must see that military operations are accompanied by visible improvements in their neighborhoods and communities. So America will hold the Iraqi Government to the benchmarks it has announced.\" [Bush Address to the Nation on the War on Terror in Iraq, 1/10/07]\nRice: Progress on Political Elements Are Important for Surge to Work. In January testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary Rice said, \"The president last night made clear that the augmentation of our forces is to support the Iraqis in that goal of returning control and civility to their capital. He also noted that there are also very important strategic -- important economic and political elements that must be followed up if clear, hold and build is to actually work this way.\" [Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 1/11/07]\nGates: Bush Strategy Includes Strengthening of Political Areas. In testimony on the president's surge policy, Secretary Gates, said, \"First, this strategy entails a strengthening across all aspects of the war effort, military and non-military, including the economic, governance and political areas. Overcoming the challenges in Iraq cannot be achieved simply by military means, no matter how large or sustained, without progress by the Iraqis in addressing the underlying issues dividing the country.\" [Gates Testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, 1/12/07]\nMcCain Attacked Clinton; You Would have to \"Suspend Disbelief\" to Believe the Surge was Not Succeeding. On ABC's \"This Week,\" Sen. John McCain said, \"Well, is that the same Senator Clinton that said she had to suspend disbelief in order to acknowledge that the strategy of the surge was succeeding? Clearly, it's succeeding. You would have to suspend disbelief to believe that it's not. Look, now the same people that seven or eight months ago were saying the military situation can't -- you can't succeed militarily. We've succeeded militarily.\" [ABC, This Week, 11/25/07]\nGiuliani Said it would be a \"Big Mistake\" to Pull Troops Out of Iraq while There is Chance For Success. During an event in New Hampshire a democratic voter called for an end to the war in Iraq. \"I disagree with you,\" Giuliani said calmly. \"I think it would be a very big mistake to pull them out while the general there thinks they can still be successful.\" [Associated Press, 11/25/07]\nGraham Said the Surge is Working \"Amazingly Well;\" Political Dividends Will Come \"Soon.\" Asked on FOX News Sunday if the surge is working, Sen. Lindsey Graham said, \"It's working amazingly well, beyond my expectations. I think history will judge the surge as probably the most successful counterinsurgency military operation in history. Violence is down. Economic activity is up. It's not just about more troops. It's how the troops are used. So hats off to General Petraeus and all under his command. You're making military history and a phenomenal success. I was amazed, really. … . I'm seeing the surge work beyond my expectation. And I think we will have political dividends at the national level in Baghdad soon.\" [FOX News Sunday, 11/25/07]\n",

Biden will outline his plan to invest $2 billion in hiring 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size particularly in early grades. Students in small classes in elementary grades are as much as half a year ahead of students from larger classes by the time they get to 5th grade.\n\"We can't continue to ignore the fact that half of all new teachers leave the profession in five years because of lack of pay and lack of support,\" said Sen. Biden. \"We have to transform the way we prepare, support and pay teachers.\"\nTeacher attrition costs schools as much as $7 billion each year. Sen. Biden would invest half that amount - about $3 billion a year - in programs to increase teacher pay by rewarding them for working in high-need schools, compensating them for mentoring beginning teachers, and helping teachers repay student loans.\n\"Nations we consider our peers and competitors in the global economy invest more in their teachers - in Japan, for example, teachers' salaries are comparable to engineers,\" said Sen. Biden. \"We can do better in America.\"\nTo make the American education system the strongest in the world, Sen. Biden would focus on moving to a 16-year public education system instead of the current 12-year system, by adding two years of preschool at the beginning and a minimum of two years of education after high school.\n\"Under a Biden Administration, education will be our national domestic priority. The problems we face as a nation are too great - The stakes too high - for us to waste precious time with failed leadership, empty promises, and half-measures. The time to act is now.\"\n",

    "text": "\nDes Moines, IA (November 28, 2007) - Sen. Biden today addressed the Iowa Association of Counties in Des Moines where he spoke about the need to end the war in Iraq without leaving chaos behind so that we can address problems here at home:\n\"This whole notion that the surge is working is fantasy. Anything we ask our military to do they can do, and they have succeeded. The troops, they're absolutely incredible. They get up on those humvees knowing they might get blown up every day. They've done their job. But the President hasn't done his. The whole point of the surge was to provide breathing room for Iraqis to get together to work out a political solution. There has been no progress on that front and no evidence there will be progress. Without a lasting political settlement, our troops are a stop gap. The President needs to stop pursuing this failed strategy of trying to build a strong central government in Iraq and get the world behind my plan to help the Iraqis decentralize power and give each community local control over their daily lives. 75 United States Senators voted for my resolution. The vast majority of the foreign policy establishment now supports it and so do more and more Iraqis. It's the only way we can leave Iraq without leaving chaos behind.\"\n",

    "text": "\n[Portsmouth, NH (November 29, 2007) - Today in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Sen. Joe Biden discussed the failure of President Bush's surge strategy to produce political reconciliation. Sen. Biden is the only candidate to have offered a political solution for the Iraqi civil war, so that we do not leave chaos behind. He also explained the connection between the Bush administration's rhetoric on Iran and the higher energy prices Americans are paying at the pump. Sen. Biden delivered his remarks at the Pease International Tradeport.]\n\"Security in Iraq is better, though it remains an incredibly dangerous and violent place,\" said Sen. Biden. \"That's great news and it is due in no small measure to the extraordinary skill and bravery of our troops. They will accomplish any mission we give them. Over and over again, they've done their job in Iraq.\n\"The problem is, the President has not done his.\n\"Remember, the stated purpose of the surge was to allow Iraqis to come together politically. There is no evidence - none - that that has happened. And there is no evidence - none - that it will happen so long as the Bush administration and its supporters stick to the failed strategy of trying to build a strong central government in Iraq that wins the trust of its people.\n\"There is only one path to a durable political settlement in Iraq and it's the one I proposed more than a year ago and that 74 other senators recently endorsed: decentralize power… give Iraqis local control over the police, jobs, education, services… keep a limited central government to distribute oil revenues… and bring in the UN to oversee this political settlement.\"\nSen. Biden also discussed how the rising cost of gasoline for America's working families is tied to the mismanagement of our relationship with Iran.\n\"There's another consequence to having 160,000 American soldiers stuck in Iraq: it dramatically undermines our credibility and flexibility to deal with other challenges, starting with a country right next door: Iran,\" said Sen. Biden.\n\"Right now, you're paying on average $3/gallon for gas. And heating oil costs about $3.23/gallon, a full dollar more than it did this time last year.\n\"What does that have to do with our Iran policy? Everything. Just connect the dots.\n\"The price of every barrel of oil includes what the energy experts call a 'security premium' - an extra cost directly tied to tension and the risk of conflict in the Middle East. The more tensions rise, the higher the security premium goes, because people betting on the long term price of oil anticipate supply disruptions.\n\"Right now, a barrel of oil costs 100 dollars. But a full 30 dollars of that is the security premium. That's right: nearly one-third of the cost of oil pays for that security premium.\n\"So what happens when President Bush or Vice President Cheney start talking about \"World War III\" with Iran… or when Congress votes to designate a large chunk of Iran's military a \"terrorist organization?\"\n\"First, it plays right into President Ahmadinejad's hands because it allows him to distract the Iranian people from the terrible failures of his leadership.\n\"But second, it ratchets up tension with Iran, which means the security premium goes up and oil prices go through the roof.\n\"That security premium comes right out of your pockets here in New Hampshire. And it goes right into the coffers of the Iranian government, propping up their President and his extreme policies.\n\"It's hard to think of a more self-defeating policy.\"\n",

    "text": "\nConcord, NH (November 29, 2007) - During last night's CNN/YouTube Republican presidential debate in St. Petersburg, Florida, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney refused to say whether waterboarding was torture. In addition, Romney expressed his support for the Bush administration's practice of sending and keeping prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.\n\"Mitt Romney should know better,\" said Sen. Biden. \"Anyone seeking the Presidency who doesn't understand that waterboarding is torture should not be leading American troops. I bet Mitt Romney would not have any doubt that waterboarding is torture if he found that our troops, once captured, were facing this treatment.\n\"As President I will return America to its moral leadership in the world. In my inaugural address I will reject, for the whole world to hear, this administration's definition of torture that Mitt Romney endorsed last evening.\n\"This administration redefined what constitutes torture under the Geneva conventions, saying that that there is no torture unless there is organ failure or death. That is Orwellian. We helped establish rules against torture to protect our forces and to uphold our values. By going back on these ideals, we have lost all credibility abroad, we're giving the extremists their best recruiting tool and we're getting no security gain. What President Bush is doing and Governor Romney endorsed is wrong and self-defeating.\"\nRomney Refused to Call Waterboarding Torture or Rule it Out as an Interrogation Technique. Asked whether or not he would call waterboarding torture, Mitt Romney said, \"I do not believe that as a presidential candidate, it is wise for us to describe precisely what techniques we will use in interrogating people.\" [CNN/YouTube Republican Debate, 11/28/07]\nRomney Said Sending and Keeping Prisoners at Guantanamo \"Exactly How it Ought to Be.\" Mitt Romney said, \"I want to make sure these folks are kept at Guantanamo. I don't want the people that are carrying out attacks on this country to be brought into our jail system and be given legal representation in this country. I want to make sure that what happened to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed happens to other people who are terrorists. He was captured. He was the so-called mastermind of the 9/11 tragedy. And he turned to his captors and he said, 'I'll see you in New York with my lawyers.' I presume ACLU lawyers. Well, that's not what happened. He went to Guantanamo and he met G.I.s and CIA interrogators. And that's just exactly how it ought to be.\" [CNN/YouTube Republican Debate, 11/28/07]\n",

The Regional Chairs, which will advise Sen. Biden on areas of concern to veterans, has planned the statewide forums in order to give Iowa veterans, their families, and their communities the opportunity to influence the national dialogue on veterans issues. This Sunday, Sen. Biden will join members of Iowa Veterans for Biden for their inaugural community forum at the Beaverdale VFW Hall in Des Moines. The campaign also announced upcoming forums in Fort Dodge, Burlington, Mason City, Sioux City and Waterloo.\n\"I am honored to have the support of these men and women who have so nobly served our country,\" said Biden. \"Together, we will ensure that veterans' voices are heard in the living rooms of voters here in Iowa and across the country.\"\nThe Iowa Veterans for Biden committee is comprised of veterans who have served in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Korea, the Cold War and World War II, Iowa state representatives and family members of fallen servicemen.\n\"I'm honored to serve on Senator Biden's advisory board,\" said Jeremy Reynolds of Grundy Center, an Iraq War Veteran and Regional Chair of Iowa Veterans for Biden. \"Over the course of his career, he has been an outstanding voice for servicemen and women in the field and the veterans that return home. This tour will give us a chance to discuss with Iowans the issues that affect them and their families and gives us a chance to listen to their concerns and bring them to our next commander-in-chief.\"\nThe series of forums will address America's shared responsibility in caring for our men and women in uniform including a true reform of the Veterans Administration system, providing necessary armor and vehicles to troops in the field, Sen. Biden's plan for Iraq and the importance of garner bi-partisan support in bring this war to a conclusion.\nSen. Biden recently unveiled his plan to keep America's promise to veterans by reforming the Veterans Administration and making it more responsive to the needs of our veterans once they return home from the battlefield as well as our veterans who have already performed their service.\n\"Our commitment to those who have admirably served our country must be without question,\" said Senator Biden. \"Just as we must protect them and give them everything they need on the battlefield, we owe our brave soldiers the same support upon their return home. This is our sacred obligation.\"\nSen. Biden believes that all veterans must have access to health care and that the Department of Veterans Affairs has a fundamental responsibility to address their varying care needs in a timely manner. His five-point plan for VA reform aims to improve the handling of claims, eliminate restrictions on veterans' access to health care, accommodate the long-term care needs of veterans, ensure adequate treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and improve the provision of care to all veterans.\nIOWA VETERANS FOR BIDEN REGIONAL CHAIRS\n\n\n\n\nName\nJohn Whitaker\n\n\nService\nState Representative, Father of Iraq Veteran\n\n\nCity\nHillsboro\n\n\n\n\nMcKinley Bailey\n\n\nState Representative, Iraq and Afghanistan Veteran\n\n\nWebster City\n\n\n\n\nDick Taylor\n\n\nState Representative, Korean War Veteran, Navy\n\n\nCedar Rapids\n\n\n\n\nChris Frosheiser\n\n\nSon was killed in Iraq by and IED\n\n\nAltoona\n\n\n\n\nRandy Flaherty\n\n\nCold War Veteran, Navy\n\n\nMason City\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Reynolds\n\n\nIraq War Veteran, Iowa National Guard\n\n\nGrundy Center\n\n\n\n\nCal Halliburton\n\n\nVietnam War Veteran, Army\n\n\nAmes\n\n\n\n\nMichael Trenary\n\n\nIraq War Veteran, Iowa National Guard\n\n\nFort Dodge\n\n\n\n\nFred Hunter\n\n\nKorean War Veteran, Navy\n\n\nDes Moines\n\n\n\n\nEugene Menke\n\n\nWWII Veteran, Navy\n\n\nBurlington\n\n\n\n\nJohn Stromberg\n\n\nKorean War Veteran, Air Force\n\n\nDavenport\n\n\n\n\nEmil Burke\n\n\nWWII Veteran, Army Air Corps\n\n\nGrinnell\n\n\n\n\nTim Nash\n\n\nFather of Iraq War Veteran\n\n\nMarion\n\n\n\n\nJose Cortez\n\n\nIraq War Veteran, Iowa National Guard\n\n\nCouncil Bluffs\n\n\n\n\nJames Timmer\n\n\nWWII Veteran, Marine Corps\n\n\nClinton\n\n\n\n\nIOWA VETERANS FOR BIDEN COMMUNITY FORUMS TOUR\n\nMonday, December 11th - Fort Dodge\nThursday, December 14th - Mason City\nTuesday, December 18th - Burlington\nThursday, December 20th - Sioux City\nFriday, December 28th - Waterloo\n",

    "text": "\nDes Moines, IA (December 1, 2007) - While inclement weather delayed Sen. Biden's participation in tonight's Brown and Black forum at North High School, panelists and audience members wasted no time asking for his perspectives on a range of domestic and foreign policy issues.\nBiden for President Campaign Manager Luis Navarro issued the following statement following the Brown and Black Democratic Presidential Forum tonight in Des Moines, IA:\n\"Sen. Biden has once again demonstrated that he is the only candidate with the experience and judgment to be Commander in Chief from Day One. Tonight, he left no doubt as to who has the longest record on fighting for the legal, immigration, education and economic reforms necessary to achieve real social justice for all Americans. Voters are taking notice of Joe Biden's commitment to action-and the thirty-five year legislative career on social justice that proves it.\"\nBelow is a fact sheet highlighting Sen. Biden's record of achievement on social issues.\n###\nSENATOR JOE BIDEN: KEEPING THE PROMISE\nEqual Justice & A Second Chance\nThe Biden Crime Law: Joe Biden wrote the legislation that put 100,000 cops on the streets, built drug courts to improve rehabilitation treatment for non-violent offenders and worked with community groups like the Boys and Girls Clubs and Police Athletic Leagues to keep kids off the streets and out of trouble, reducing crime eight years in a row. His 1994 Crime Bill put $10 billion into prevention - and he recently introduced a package that will provide over $5 billion for prevention in the next five years. Throughout his career he has fought for separate facilities for juvenile and adult prisoners so that we teach young people who make a mistake how to be a better citizen, not a better criminal.\nA Second Chance: Reducing the Number of Repeat Offenders. Senator Biden is a long time supporter of programs to end the cycle of recidivism that leads 66 percent of the 650,000 prisoners released each year back to prison. His Second Chance Act would provide $324 million to help prisoners re-entering our communities with housing, education and job training, drug treatment, and mental health services. Giving them - and the children and families who depend on them - a second chance to get back on their feet so that they can become productive members of society.\nEliminating Unjust Sentencing Disparities. Senator Biden is working to address injustice by completely eliminating the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. He would eliminate completely the 100:1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses; eliminate the mandatory minimum sentence for simple possession of crack cocaine; authorize funds for prison and jail-based drug treatment programs and provide additional resources to law enforcement to go after major drug traffickers.\nCombating Hate Crimes And Intimidation. The Jena 6 case, the rash of noose incidents around the country and the rise in hate crimes of 8 percent in the last year are part of a destructive and disturbing trend. Yet the nation's watchdogs - the Justice Department, the FBI and the US Commission on Civil Rights - have done virtually nothing. Senator Biden would provide additional resources to investigate and vigorously prosecute hate crimes and he would not allow federal law enforcement to stand by while people are harassed, intimidated or prosecuted because of their race, religion or sexual orientation.\nAddressing Violence. The most likely cause of death for African American males between the age of 15 and 35 is homicide. Senator Biden believes this is a national crisis that requires a national solution that goes beyond tougher law enforcement or gun control. He would convene a task force of religious leaders, community leaders, elected officials, parents, entertainers and young people to address the violence that tragically takes the lives of so many.\nEnding Racial Profiling. Racial profiling reinforces the stereotypes that lead to profiling in the first place - the false perception that because of the color of your skin you are more likely to commit a crime. Senator Biden opposes racial profiling.\nEnding Violence Against Women: Joe Biden has often said the Violence Against Women Act is his proudest achievement in the Senate. The law strengthened the national network of shelters so that abused women had a place to go and provided funding for a national hotline that has served over 1.5 million women. Domestic violence rates have dropped by 50 percent since the implementation of the Violence Against Women Act, and rape has dropped by 60 percent. Joe Biden continues to be committed to this cause and is now working to provide legal services to women in need.\nCivil Rights\nJudge the Judges: The recent Supreme Court term proves that judges and justices can undo decades of progress on civil rights. That's why Joe Biden has a well-earned reputation of being tough on judging judicial appointments. As chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, he kept Robert Bork off the Supreme Court. More recently, as a senior member of the Committee, he strongly opposed putting Bush nominees John Roberts and Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court, fearing what unfortunately has proven true - they want to erase decades of progress on civil rights. He also opposed the nomination of Leslie Southwick to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in part because his record raised serious questions about his commitment to fairness. As the Bush Administration continues to try to pack federal courts with judges committed to a narrow view of the Constitution that denies minorities and women equal protection, Joe Biden will remain the voice of opposition.\nProtecting Voting Rights. Senator Biden was a vocal advocate and cosponsor for renewing key sections of the Voting Rights Act - which were reauthorized in July 2006. But he recognizes that more needs to be done to protect voting rights. He would direct the Department of Justice to vigorously enforce voting rights laws. Senator Biden would prohibit and punish deceptive practices that keep voters from voting on election day, require states to adequately staff and equip all polling locations; require electronic voting systems to have a voter-verified paper ballot; and restore the right to vote to felons who have done their time and repaid their debt unless someone is convicted of treason.\nThe Subprime Crisis: Protecting Homeownership and Keeping Communities Strong\nAddressing Discrimination. Minority borrowers are far more likely to be steered into high-cost subprime loans than other borrowers. In 2006 half of home loans to African Americans were subprime and 40 percent of home loans to Latino and Hispanic families were subprime. As a result families who got these subprime loans are particularly vulnerable to foreclosure - especially as low teaser rates give way to higher payments. Senator Biden believes that this is a new form of redlining and just as discriminatory. He would investigate widespread discrimination by lenders.\nWork to keep people in their homes. Senator Biden would work with lenders to help families facing rising rates renegotiate their loans so that they can afford them. He would expand counseling services and resources for the Federal Housing Administration to provide federally backed loans. Senator Biden would crack down on unscrupulous brokers and eliminate abusive practices like prepayment penalties and require taxes and insurance to be included in assessment so that people buying a home know what the all the costs will be.\nProtect homes in bankruptcy. Senator Biden would allow bankruptcy courts to modify mortgages by making changes in repayment timeframes and interest rates. This sort of modification is currently prohibited on primary homes but allowed on vacation homes and family farms.\nInvest in economic development. Senator Biden would double funding for Community Development Block Grants which can be used by cities and local governments for everything from replacing lead pipes and fixing sidewalks to building community centers and economic development projects. It is one of the best sources of funding for local governments for economic development. But the CDBG program has been cut by 15 percent in the last two years. Senator Biden would restore funding and double it - providing a much-needed infusion for cities that need help improving infrastructure and creating opportunity. The FY 08 budget proposes $2.98 billion for the Community Development Block Grant program (CDBG), a cut of $736 million below the 2007 level and $807 million below the level adjusted for inflation.\nEducation\nEarly childhood education and preschool. Infants and toddlers who receive nurturing, high quality care are better able to learn. An infant whose mother speaks to her regularly will learn 300 more words by the time she's two. A child who goes to preschool with books, structure, and activities, starts school better prepared. She has a better shot of making it to middle school with grade-level reading and math skills, graduating high school, and going to college. Studies have shown the results. Of kids from similar backgrounds who were enrolled in quality preschool 65 percent graduated from high school where just 45 percent of non-preschoolers did. Senator Biden would fully fund Head Start and Early Head Start - doubling the number of children in Head Start and quadrupling the number of children in Early Head Start.\nRetaining and preparing teachers. Half of all new teachers leave within the first five years - a quarter of a million teachers leave every year. Teacher attrition costs our schools $2-$7 billion a year. For $3 billion we could transform the way we prepare and support teachers as well as improving teacher pay by: (1) funding mentoring of new teachers, (2) providing scholarship money for teachers to defray the costs of education in exchange for a four-year commitment to teaching in a high need school, and (3) designing incentives to reward high quality and effective professional development like National Board Certification.\nAfterschool Programs. Senator Biden supports expanding after school programs and 21st Century Learning Centers. The hours between 3pm and 6pm are the peak hours for juvenile crime and experimentation with drugs, alcohol, cigarettes and sex. Afterschool programs provide a wide range of services from training in sports or the arts to tutoring. They keep kids off the streets and engaged in productive activities. But afterschool programs are underfunded by more than a billion dollars.\nAccess to College. Senator Biden does not believe that college should be out of reach for any student because of cost. Senator Biden's College ACCESS plan creates a refundable $3,000 tax credit per student for families making up to $166,000 a year paying college tuition. This credit will cover the average tuition cost of two-year public colleges ($2,300) and half the average cost of tuition at four-year public colleges ($5,600). Senator Biden's ACCESS plan also expands Pell Grants by $2,000 to $6,300. With the tax refund and Pell Grants, low income students (from families making below $50,000 a year) could receive up to $9,300 toward college - enough to cover the cost of tuition at most public colleges and universities.\nAffordable Housing\nOpportunity-rich, mixed income neighborhoods. Senator Biden would make the focus of federal housing policy breaking up concentrations of poverty instead of creating them.\nEncourage housing choice. Senator Biden would increase funding for the Section 8 voucher program so that it better meets the needs of people who are eligible. Only one in three eligible families gets assistance now. Hundreds of working families living in high-rent cities have no place to go.\nHelp cities develop affordable housing. Senator Biden supports expanding the Low Income Housing Tax Credit to lower the financing costs of housing developments so that the rental prices are more affordable (lower than market rates).\nFund programs to revitalize neighborhoods and public housing. The HOPE VI program finances the rehabilitation of severely distressed public housing, tearing down unsafe projects and replacing them with homes. It is an important part of the revitalization of our neighborhoods. But the Bush Administration has repeatedly tried to slash funding for the program. Senator Biden would restore funding for it.\nHealthy Cities\nReduce smog. Senator Biden would tighten health standards for particulates and smog and reduce emissions from power plants. Power plant pollution - which contributes to ground level ozone - can worsen asthma and contributes to health problems. Senator Biden supports legislation to tighten the rules, to reduce emissions from power plants, instead of rolling back important provisions. He does not believe that \"the cost of doing business\" requires us to accept poor air quality.\nMake polluters pay. Nearly 70 million Americans, including 10 million children, live within four miles of a Superfund toxic waste site - many of them in urban areas. The Superfund law and its \"polluter pays\" fees have allowed agencies to clean up many of the most serious contamination cases. But more than ten years ago the authority for the \"polluter pays\" fees expired. Since then, the Superfund Trust Fund, the backbone of the cleanup effort, has been depleted. Cleanup costs have shifted from industry to taxpayer and the pace of cleanup has slowed. Senator Biden would restore the Superfund polluter pays program. The cost of doing business does not require us to accept poor air quality.\n",

    "text": "\nIowa City, IA (December 3, 2007) - Today, following the release of the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) report on Iran's nuclear intentions and capabilities, Sen. Joe Biden blasted the Bush Administration's irresponsible rhetoric on Iran which is further destabilizing the Middle East and increasing the energy costs for all Americans. Biden outlined his plan for preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and warned that if this Administration went to war with Iran without Congressional approval, he would move to impeach President Bush.\nEarlier today, the intelligence community released what's called a National Intelligence Estimate on Iran's nuclear intentions and capabilities. The conclusions are, figuratively speaking, explosive.\n\"The Estimate found that Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 and, as of the middle of this year, had not restarted it. Iran did resume work on uranium enrichment, which is the most likely method it would use to produce the fissile material for a bomb. But at its current pace, the NIE concluded that Iran could produce that material no earlier than the end of 2009 - but that this is very unlikely. More likely is that Iran will be capable of making enough material for a bomb sometime between 2010 and 2015.\n\"This means that the answers to the questions I posed are no, war is not inevitable and yes, we can prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. There is still time for diplomatic engagement and economic pressure to work. There is still time to protect our interests without using force.\"\nSen. Biden went on to discuss the destabilizing effect of the Administration's increasing rhetoric on Iran.\n\"Even talk of war is counter-productive to our interests - it is literally a gift to President Ahmadinejad and the extremists. When President Bush puts the words \"Iran\" and \"World War III\" in the same sentence or when the Senate votes to designate a large part of Iran's military a \"terrorist\" organization the main result is to increase tensions with Iran.\n\"That, in turn, does two things.\n\"First, it distracts the Iranian people from the incredible failures of Ahmadinejad's leadership, while silencing his critics and forcing them to rally around the flag. Second, tension adds directly to the security premium we pay for oil -- an extra cost directly tied to the risk of conflict in the Middle East. The more tensions rise, the higher the security premium goes, because people betting on the long term price of oil anticipate supply disruptions.\n\"Right now, a barrel of oil costs almost 100 dollars. But a full 30 dollars of that is the security premium. That security premium comes out of your pockets at the pump or when you pay your home heating bills. It goes into Iran's coffers tens of billions of dollars propping up the extremists.\n\"It's hard to think of a more self-defeating policy.\"\nSen. Biden also declared that if the Administration took the nation to war without Congressional approval, he would call for President Bush's impeachment.\n\"It is precisely because the consequences of war - intended or otherwise - can be so profound and complicated that our Founding Fathers vested in Congress, not the President, the power to initiate war, except to repel an imminent attack on the United States or its citizens. They reasoned that requiring the President to come to Congress first would slow things down… allow for more careful decision making before sending Americans to fight and die and ensure broader public support.\n\"The Founding Fathers were, as in most things, profoundly right. That's why I want to be very clear: if the President takes us to war with Iran without Congressional approval, I will call for his impeachment.\n\"I do not say this lightly or to be provocative. I am dead serious. I have chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee. I still teach constitutional law. I've consulted with some of our leading constitutional scholars. The Constitution is clear. And so am I.\n\"I'm saying this now to put the administration on notice and hopefully to deter the President from taking unilateral action in the last year of his administration. If war is warranted with a nation of 70 million people, it warrants coming to Congress and the American people first.\"\nSen. Biden concluded by laying out his own strategy for winning in Iran without resorting to war.\n\"Instead of regime change, we need to focus on conduct change.\n\"First, working with allies and partners, not acting alone, we must make it very clear to Iran what it risks in terms of isolation if it continues to pursue nuclear weapons, but also what it stands to gain -- in terms of economic benefits, security guarantees, integration into the region and diplomatic relations - if it does the right thing. We have to be deliberate, patient and determined. We have to listen, not just lecture.\n\"Second, we need to do a far better job managing great power relations with China, Russia, and our allies in Europe. We need a common understanding with them because they have more leverage than we do.\n\"Even as Europe is reducing trade with Iran, China is picking up the slack. China can have a huge impact on Iran's calculus. But getting China or Russia on the same page will not happen by delegating the matter to the State Department. It will require sustained, presidential-level engagement - something this Administration has shown little interest in or aptitude for.\n\"Third, we must exploit growing cracks within the ruling elite and between Iran's rulers and its people.\n\"Iran is not a monolith. President Ahmadinejad does not have the final word. And he is facing unprecedented opposition from a new alliance of pragmatic conservatives and reformers. They hope to defeat many Ahmadinejad supporters in elections for the Iranian parliament - the Majlis - next March. Our biggest allies are the Iranian people. They are open to America. They don't like a regime that denies them basic political and social rights and that can't deal with corruption, high unemployment and inflation.\n\"We should bring together renowned economists and the talented pool of Iranian-American business leaders. I'd ask them to lay out a positive vision for what the Iranian economy could look like in five years if Iran's leaders make the right decisions, sanctions end, and Iran becomes integrated with the world economy. I'd ask them to detail the benefits that would flow to ordinary Iranians and I would make their findings widely known in Iran.\n\"We should promote people-to-people interaction by changing our self-defeating sanctions laws that prevent American non-governmental groups from spending their money in Iran. When I tried to do this last year, the Bush Administration blocked me. Instead, it has pursued the disastrous policy of secretly funneling US government money to Iranians it won't identify, providing an excuse for the regime to crack down on scores of innocent Iranian activists.\n\"And we should do everything in our power to engage the Iranian people. They need to know it is their government, not the U.S. that is choosing confrontation over cooperation. So we should tone down the rhetoric and talk. It's amazing how little faith this administration has in the power of America's ideas and ideals.\n\"Fourth, Iran can't be dealt with in isolation. We have to connect the dots.\n\"To weaken the hard-liners in Iran, we should actively encourage Israeli-Syrian talks. If we can weaken the Iranian-Syrian marriage of convenience, we can eliminate the main hub for Iran's projection of influence into the heart of the Middle East, through Hamas and Hezbollah.\n\"We also need determined diplomacy to drive a political settlement in Iraq. I've laid out a specific plan on how to do that. 75 US Senators - Democrats and Republicans - voted for it. The plan calls for convening a UN conference with the major world powers, Iraq and its neighbors to build a political settlement based on the federalism provisions of Iraq's Constitution.\n\"If we don't make Iran part of the solution, it will remain part of the problem. Yes, Iran likes the status quo, with us tied down, bleeding and unable to use Iraq as a launching pad into Iran. But like all of Iraq's neighbors, Iran has no interest in Iraq's civil war turning into a regional war. If we leave without leaving behind a political settlement, Iran has as much to lose from the resulting chaos as we do.\n\"We should be smart enough to play on that interest, just as we should recognize our shared interests on Iran's Eastern border. In 2001, Iran cooperated closely with us in driving out the Taliban and establishing the Karzai government. We must re-defeat the Taliban and bring stability to Afghanistan. And we need a Pakistan policy, not a Musharraf policy. I've laid one out in detail. For many in Iran, Pakistan is the emerging security threat. A nuclear-armed Pakistan aligned with or controlled by radicals who see the majority Shi'a of Iran as apostates is Iran's worst nightmare.\n\"Fifth, we need an energy policy that ends our dependence on the \"Axis of Oil.\"\n\"We must avoid war with Iran. We must prevent a nuclear Iran. We can do both. We have time, but we don't have a comprehensive strategy. As the next president, I will have to flip the administration's policy on its head. I will end the war in Iraq instead of starting war with Iran. I know what to do on both fronts. Thank you for listening.\"\nSen. Biden delivered his remarks to the Iowa City Foreign Relations Council at the Iowa City Public Library.\n",

    "text": "\nWashington, DC - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) issued the following statement today in response to President Bush's comments during his press conference regarding Iran:\n\"In October, President Bush raised the specter of World War III with Iran because of its pursuit of a nuclear weapon months after he had been told by our own intelligence community it was likely Iran had halted its weapons program in 2003.\n\"After all that Americans have been through, for this President to knowingly disregard or misrepresent intelligence about an issue of war and peace, is outrageous. It's exactly what he did in the run up to the war in Iraq in consistently exaggerating intelligence suggesting that Iraq had WMD, while failing to tell the American people about intelligence concluding that it did not. It further undermines America's credibility around the world - and the government's credibility here at home - at a time when that credibility is at an all-time low. And it injects more tension and instability into the Middle East at a time when we should be doing everything in our power to prevent that region from spiraling out of control.\n\"The President's actions are doubly dangerous because they undercut the cooperation we need from other countries for dealing with the real problems Iran continues to pose. The only way to get Iran to change its conduct when it comes to enriching uranium or supporting terrorists, is for a united front of major powers to make it very clear to Iran what it risks in terms of isolation if it continues down that path, but also what it stands to gain - in terms of economic benefits, security guarantees, integration into the region and diplomatic relations - if it does the right thing. The President's actions have made it far more difficult to get other countries to work with us on Iran or to believe us about anything else. It's hard to think of a more serious and self-inflicted wound to our national security.\n\"The American people deserve a President who levels with them, especially when it comes to issues of war and peace. Our partners around the world expect it. Forfeiting that trust is this President's most terrible legacy.\"\n",

Between the hidden meetings with Halliburton on energy, the warrantless wiretapping of Americans, and the vague definitions of torture he uses, Vice President Cheney wouldn't know a working democracy if he fell over it.\n\"The Vice President remains in a state of total denial. The stated purpose of the surge was to buy time for political progress in Iraq. There hasn't been any and there is no evidence there will be any until this administration abandons its failed policy of trying to build a strong central government in Baghdad and implements the plan I proposed and that 75 Senators support. That plan would decentralize Iraq and bring responsibilities and resources down to the local level. It remains the only way forward if we want to leave Iraq without leaving chaos behind.\n\"Vice President Cheney has been consistently wrong about Iraq, from his claim it had reconstituted nuclear weapons before the war to his assertion more than two years ago that the insurgency was in its last throes.\"\n",

    "text": "\nWilmington, DE (December 6, 2007) - The White House has once again changed its story about what President Bush knew about Iran's nuclear weapons program while he was escalating his rhetoric about relations with that country. Last night, the White House said that President Bush was told in August by Director of National Intelligence John McConnell that Iran's nuclear weapons program \"may be suspended.\" As CNN noted, the new account from White House Press Secretary Dana Perino \"seems to contradict the president's version of his August conversation with McConnell and raised new questions about why Bush continued to warn the American public about a threat from Iran two months after being told a new assessment was in the works.\" [CNN.com, 12/5/07]\nDespite these revelations, Perino appeared last night on Fox News' \"O'Reilly Factor\" to dismiss Sen. Biden's criticisms of this ongoing scandal and even said that \"what I'd say to Senator Biden is 'welcome to the real world.'\"\nPerino also tried to explain away the President's comments about Iran and World War III: \"'The president didn't say we're going to cause World War III,' Perino said. 'He was saying he wanted to avoid World War III.'\" [CNN.com, 12/5/07]\nSen. Biden issued the following statement:\n\"With each new day comes a new explanation of what should be simple facts. If the President was told that the Iranian nuclear program 'may be suspended,' he had no business going in front of the American people invoking a 'nuclear holocaust' and 'World War III' while reiterating his belief that Iran wants to build a nuclear weapon.\n\"The President needs to tell us what he knew and when he knew it, and then explain how that was consistent with ratcheting up the rhetoric on Iran. The American people deserve real leadership, not self-defeating statements that undermine our credibility, escalate tensions and make America less, not more, secure.\"\nOctober 21: Cheney Described Iranian Nuclear Program in the Present Tense. Cheney said, \"And now, of course, we have the inescapable reality of Iran's nuclear program; a program they claim is strictly for energy purposes, but which they have worked hard to conceal; a program carried out in complete defiance of the international community and resolutions of the U.N. Security Council. Iran is pursuing technology that could be used to develop nuclear weapons. The world knows this. The Security Council has twice imposed sanctions on Iran and called on the regime to cease enriching uranium.\" [Cheney Remarks to Washington Institute for Near Easy Policy, 10/21/07]\nOctober 17: Bush Said He Believed Iran Wanted to Build A Nuclear Weapon, Invoked World War III. During a press conference, Bush was asked, do you \"definitively believe Iran wants to build a nuclear weapon?\" Bush said, \"I think so long--until they suspend and/or make it clear that they--that their statements aren't real, yes, I believe they want to have the capacity, the knowledge, in order to make a nuclear weapon. And I know it's in the world's interest to prevent them from doing so. ... So I've told people that if you're interested in avoiding world war III, it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon.\" [Bush Press Conference, 10/17/07, emphasis added]\nOctober 4: Bush Said Iran Has \"So Far Refused\" to Suspend Nuclear Weapons Program. In remarks during a meeting with Elie Nakouzi of Al Arabiya, President Bush said, \"[T]hat's why you see us at the United Nations working with the EU countries and China and Russia to send that clear message; and that we're going to continue to impose sanctions and make it harder for the Iranian Government to operate in the world until they change their mind, until they come to a new way forward. I have said that if they suspend their nuclear program, we will be at the table.

Joe Biden stepped up pressure on the Justice Department to appoint a Special Counsel to investigate the scandal surrounding the destruction of tapes showing interrogations by the CIA:\n\"Today I am reiterating my call for the appointment of a Special Counsel to investigate the Bush Administration's latest potentially illegal action. I do not take this call for a Special Counsel lightly. I wish that this White House had enough integrity to police themselves but they have shown that they do not. This is an unfortunate trend and one that I will end immediately as President.\n\"For one, Attorney General Mukasey demonstrated during his confirmation hearing that he is unable to impartially enforce U.S. laws with regard to torture.\n\"Second, this investigation may implicate White House officials. Some press reports indicate that Deputy White House Chief of Staff Harriet Miers and CIA Director Porter Goss were involved in the process of determining whether or not the tapes should be preserved. In addition, there is a possibility that the President may also have been involved, as the White House Press Secretary noted only that the President had 'no recollection' of the decision-making process surrounding the destruction of the tapes. The tapes also reportedly show evidence of potentially illegal interrogation programs that the Administration has advocated.\n\"Finally, the White House has made previous attempts to politicize the work of the Justice Department, including the hiring and firing of US Attorneys, and the appointment of a Special Counsel would ensure prosecutorial independence.\"\n",

It is important to remember that his remarks came after we passed the Ryan White CARE Act into law and long after the scientific community had reached consensus that HIV/AIDS is not spread through casual contact. Even more telling, Governor Huckabee had the opportunity to recant his comments and chose not to do so.\n\"I urge all candidates for president, especially the Republicans debating today in Iowa, to stand in unison and reject this sort of hateful rhetoric. The American people are looking for leadership as well as good judgment.

    "text": "\nDes Moines, IA (December 14, 2007) - On December 9th, speaking on ABC's \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos,\" Sen. Joe Biden began the call for an special counsel to investigate the destruction of CIA tapes. [ABC, This Week, 12/9/07] Yesterday, Sen. John Edwards became the second Democratic presidential candidate to join the call for an independent prosecutor. During a campaign stop yesterday in Iowa, Edwards said, \"I'm completely supportive of an independent prosecutor. I think that having somebody who is not from the [Bush] Administration is the best way to get to the bottom of this.\" [Radio Iowa, 12/13/07]\nFollowing Edwards's comments, Biden for President Campaign Manager Luis Navarro issued the following statement:\n\"Sen. Biden applauds Sen. Edwards for joining his call for a special counsel to investigate the Bush White House's involvement in the CIA tapes scandal. Presidential candidates who are calling only for a congressional investigation are not doing enough. Other presidential candidates should also put pressure on the administration and recognize the need for an independent review of the facts in this case. It would be nice if this administration had enough integrity to police itself but unfortunately it does not.\"\nToday, the Sioux City Journal published an op-ed by Sen. Biden. \"The evidence destroyed depicted the president's policy of snatching terrorist suspects from the streets of foreign countries, hiding them away in secret prisons, and torturing them. The president has created a culture of criminal misconduct and cover up, has injected politics into the administration of justice, and has made public policy a slave to his ideology,\" wrote Sen. Biden. \"Moreover, the investigation necessitates that criminal investigators pose direct questions to, and demand answers of, high-ranking administration officials.\"\nDecember 11th: Richardson Called on Congress to Investigate CIA Torture-Tapes Scandal. \"It is imperative that Congress get to the bottom of the CIA torture-tapes scandal,\" Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico said. \"The American people deserve to know whether laws were violated and whether the president was directly involved in illegal activities. Torture is a black-and-white moral issue.\" [Richardson Press Release, 12/11/07; Chicago Tribune, 12/12/07]\nDecember 7th: Obama Said CIA Incident Deserves Further Congressional Inquiry. In a press release, Sen. Obama said, \"Mr. President, this incident deserves further congressional oversight and inquiry - neither the CIA nor this interrogation program is immune to our laws. This is yet another chapter in a dark period in our constitutional history.\" [Obama Press Release, 12/7/07]\nDecember 7th: Clinton: We're Going to Be Looking Into This Vigorously. Sen. Clinton said, \"It raises some very serious concerns. So we're going to be looking into this vigorously to determine exactly what happened, what were the reasons for the destruction of the tapes -- what was the C.I.A. trying to protect.\" [MSNBC, First Read, 12/7/07]\nDecember 7th: Dodd Said CIA Tapes should be \"Thoroughly Investigated.\" During an appearance on CNN's \"Situation Room,\" Sen. Dodd said, \"If we're opposed and agree that torture is wrong and unconstitutional, you can't have agencies of this government engaging in those kinds of activities. And I think, frankly, many people suspect that those tapes would have revealed exactly that. And that's why there's so much concern, why it ought to be investigated thoroughly. … There's something going on here. We're not getting the full story, hence the reason why there should be an investigation of this, because it again goes to the heart of our national security, our protection, our safety, our isolation in the world. That's why this is so important. [CNN, Situation Room, 12/7/07, emphasis added]\n",

Joe Biden today received the endorsement of Keokuk Mayor David Gudgel. First elected in 2001, Mayor Gudgel is currently serving his fourth consecutive term as Mayor of Keokuk. Prior to his public service, Mayor Gudgel was Senior Account Manager for W.R. Grace, an industrial chemical company, for 20 years.\n\"One of the main reasons I decided to support Sen. Biden was his grasp of foreign policy and the problems we face internationally,\" said Mayor Gudgel. \"And as someone who shares my commitment to restoring the middle class, I believe Joe is the best candidate to address our problems at home and throughout the world.\"\nSen. Biden said, \"Over his four consecutive terms serving the people of Keokuk, Mayor Gudgel has worked tirelessly to protect hard-working Iowans and restore the middle class. He shares my concern about our diminished standing in the world and my vision for restoring America to greatness. I am tremendously proud that he has pledged his support to my campaign.\"\nMayor Gudgel announced his support following a campaign event at the home of Keokuk City Councilwoman Susan Dunek this weekend. The Biden for President Campaign recently announced that Councilwoman Dunek would serve on its statewide steering committee with over 50 other local leaders from across the Hawkeye State.\nMayor Gudgel and Councilwoman Dunek have joined an impressive group of local elected officials and state legislators who have endorsed Senator Biden in Iowa. To date, 14 state legislators—and a majority of the House Democratic leadership—have endorsed Senator Biden, including State Sen. Joe Seng (Davenport), House Majority Leader Rep.

    "text": "\n\n\"In The 21st Century, Education Has Become A Critical National Security Issue\"\n\nFort Dodge, IA (December 19, 2007): Today at the Fort Dodge Public Library in Fort Dodge, Iowa, Sen. Joe Biden responded to new international test results showing that U.S. students lag behind their peers in other countries.\nAmerica's 15 year-olds recently ranked 25th in mathematics and 21st in science among the 30 member countries that make up the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Just 70 percent of American high school students reach graduation day. The United States now ranks 17th in the world in high-school graduation rates and 14th in college graduation rates.\n\"I want to make something very clear,\" said Sen. Biden. \"It is not our students who failed these tests - it is our policies that are failing our students.\"\nSen. Biden called for an overhaul of No Child Left Behind and comprehensive education reform including: universal preschool, more time spent on learning, putting a well-paid effective teacher in every classroom, expanding service opportunities for middle and high school students and providing a minimum of two years of higher education for every student.\n\"Education is more than just math, science, and reading. Our focus on multiple choice tests has narrowed the curriculum and the ability of teachers to innovate,\" said Sen. Biden. \"And that shows - not just in the math and science test scores - but in the basic education our students are missing: American history and training in how our government works.\"\nSen. Biden noted that in the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress test on civics education, only half of 8th graders were able to link religious freedom to the Bill of Rights and only half of 12th graders were able to identify the President's role in foreign policy. Only 47 percent of high school seniors have mastered a minimum level of U.S. history. Only half of U.S. high school students knew that the sentence \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal\" is in the Declaration of Independence.\n\"Too many students are simply not getting a basic education in how democracy works,\" said Sen. Biden. \"That's a crisis at a time when our civil liberties are under assault by an administration that has ignored basic protections such as habeas corpus, disregarded the balance of power and secretly authorized torture.\"\nSen. Biden announced that he would invest in grants to develop civics curriculums for use in schools. He called for providing service opportunities through programs such as Americorps for middle and high school students and rewarding national service with help for college.\n\"My mother has an expression: 'children tend to become that which you expect of them. I want a country where we expect much from America's children,\" said Sen. Biden. \"As President, I assure you: education will always be my top domestic priority because I believe in the next generation. I believe that they will solve climate change, make us energy independent, and bring peace to the Middle East. But we need to give them the foundation to do it.\"\nSeveral members of the Delaware State Educators Association, which recently endorsed Sen. Biden for president, were in attendance at today's event.\nMike Hoffman, DSEA Treasurer said, \"I support Sen. Biden because he's always come to the teachers to get their input. I appreciate that he recognizes that No Child Left Behind needs to be scrapped and that unfunded mandates are wrong. Teachers want to be held accountable but we need to have a fair measure of our students. When Joe Biden talks about making real education reform, I know he means what he says.\"\nMary Jo Faust, NEA Director for the Delaware State Education Association and a 2nd grade teacher in the Capital School District, added, \"I support Joe Biden because he understands my needs as a teacher. He knows that No Child Left Behind is too prescriptive, that kids need to be in school earlier and longer, and that I teach best when I have small class sizes. And he also understands that we need a professional level starting salary to retain and attract teachers in the classroom.\"\nSen. Biden's education plan and College ACCESS proposals are attached.\n",

    "text": "\n\n\"Farm Policy, Foreign Policy, And Economic Policy Are All Connected And Affect The Future Of American Farms\"\n\nWebster City, IA (December 20, 2007): Today at the All Cultures Equal, Inc. Center in Webster City, Iowa, Sen. Joe Biden discussed the importance of electing a candidate who can connect the dots between farm policy, economic policy and foreign policy to preserve the future of family and independent farms. He also outlined his own policy proposal for preserving the future of family farms in the 21st century global economy.\n\"In today's global market, instability - whether it is in Pakistan or on Wall Street - is going to hit farmers' bottom line,\" said Sen. Biden. \"I have represented an agricultural state for 35 years. We need a president who understands how all these things are related, because farm policy, foreign policy, and economic policy are all connected and affect the future of American farms. Farmers need a President who will restore stability.\"\nSen. Biden praised the Farm Bill which the Senate recently passed as a step in the right direction, but he argued that more must be done to protect the future of family farms. For example, Sen. Biden supported a payment limitations measure that would have capped payments at $250,000, but the legislation was defeated during consideration of the Farm Bill.\n\"First, we must level the field on farm subsidies,\" said Sen. Biden. \"Subsidies should do what they were designed to do, provide assistance in times of trouble, not just help the big get bigger at the expense of the little guy.\"\nSen. Biden urged that more aggressive steps be taken to make sure family farmers and independent producers are not squeezed out of markets by giant agri-business and market consolidation.\n\"Too often the deck is stacked against family farmers,\" said Sen. Biden. \"We have to make sure competition is fair.\"\nSen. Biden supports the Packer Ownership Ban and would update protections to stop packers from engaging in price manipulation and make it easier for farmers to seek redress for unfair or deceptive practices. In 2006, it is estimated that captive supplies of livestock cost family farmers and ranchers more than $5.7 billion.\nSen. Biden praised expansion of conservation measures in the Farm Bill and called for more support for new farmers.\n\"The average farmer in Iowa is over 60. We are losing the next generation of farmers,\" said Sen. Biden. \"We must stop this trend and do more to help young people get into farming.\"\nSen. Biden would also protect access to credit and capital for new farmers - including funding for alternative farming such as organic production or free range hog production. He supports helping farmers make the transition to organic production, which often allows them to collect a premium on their products, if they want to pursue that alternative. It takes three years of not using fertilizer and pesticides to make that transition and Sen. Biden would provide support to farmers during that period.\n\"Finally, we must have a smart and tough trade policy that levels the playing field for farmers in the global economy,\" said Sen. Biden. \"That means we have to fight for fair agreements, to keep markets open - and review and enforce the trade agreements we have. In my administration trade officials will ensure enforcement is a priority.\"\n",

With their help, I became the first pro-union United States Senator in Delaware history. Since then, I have never wavered in my commitment to the union movement, from fighting for Common Situs Picketing in the mid-1970s to prevailing wage, Card Check, OSHA standards, pension protections and, most recently, the Employee Free Choice Act.\n\"Today the war in Iraq is not the only war being waged by this Administration. There is also a war being waged on labor, and it is a key reason why I am running for president. I'm running to restore the middle class and unions are critical to this effort. Without a growing trade union movement, the middle class cannot grow.\n\"As president, I will immediately sign the Employee Free Choice Act into law. I will guarantee that the National Labor Relations Board returns to being a fair forum to contest unfair labor practices. I will appoint people to the Department of Labor who understand the value of unions to our economy and will make sure that pro-union officials play senior roles at the Departments of Commerce, State, Agriculture, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services. And I will also create good, union jobs by investing in our national infrastructure. We have $1.6 trillion of work to do to rebuild our roads, tunnels, ports and bridges. That means more construction, manufacturing, and transportation jobs for Americans.\n\"I am honored and heartened by the support of the Plumbers and Pipefitters in Delaware as well as so many other labor unions. As President, I will continue to work as hard for American workers in the future as I have over the past thirty-five years.\"\n",

    "text": "\nWashington, DC - Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE) issued the following statement today after the assassination of Pakistan's former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto:\n\"This is a terrible day. My heart goes out to Benazir Bhutto's family, friends and followers.\n\"Like her father before her, Benazir Bhutto worked her whole life - and gave her life - to help Pakistan become a democratic, secular and modern Muslim country. She was a woman of extraordinary courage who returned to Pakistan in the face of death threats and even after an assassination attempt the day of her return, she did not flinch. It was a privilege to know her these many years and to call her a friend.\n\"I am convinced Ms. Bhutto would have won free and fair elections next week. The fact that she was by far Pakistan's most popular leader underscores the fact that there is a vast, moderate majority in Pakistan that must have a clear voice in the system. Her assassination makes it all the more urgent that Pakistan return to a democratic path.\n\"This fall, I twice urged President Musharraf to provide better security for Ms. Bhutto and other political leaders - I wrote him before her return and after the first assassination attempt in October. The failure to protect Ms. Bhutto raises a lot of hard questions for the government and security services that must be answered.\n\"I know that Benazir's followers will be tempted to lash out in anger and violence. I urge them to remain calm - and not play into the hands of the forces of destruction. I urge Pakistan's leaders to open a fully accountable and transparent investigation. We must find out who was behind this and bring those responsible to justice. And the United States should offer any assistance necessary, including investigative teams, to get to the bottom of this horror.\n\"The way to honor Benazir Bhutto is to uphold the values for which she gave her life: democracy, moderation and social justice. I join with the Pakistani people in mourning the loss of a dear friend.\"\n",

Joe Biden criticized President Bush for his veto of the Defense Authorization Conference Report and called on him to immediately begin implementing the Biden-Brownback Resolution and Senator Biden's comprehensive exit plan for Iraq which is contained in the bill.\nIn calling for the President to act on the bill's key components, Sen. Biden stated, \"Yesterday's tragic events in Pakistan underscore the sobering effects of our failed policy in Iraq. As I've said, when President Bush abandoned Afghanistan to go to war in Iraq, it sent a message to Musharraf that the U.S. might not be there to protect him.\n\"Ending the war in Iraq would allow us to go after al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and assist the Pakistani moderates in taking control of their country. And it would allow us to get our sons and daughters out of the middle of Iraq's civil war,\" said Biden.\n\"Just moving to enact the Biden-Brownback resolution would bring the international community into the cause of long-term peace in the region. And we would further stabilize the region by committing to the bill's provision that the U.S. foreswear any long-term military bases in Iraq,\" added Biden.\n\"This war must end and the Biden-Brownback resolution is the key to that endgame,\" said Biden. \"It is essential that the President sign this provision as soon as possible and help the Iraqis implement the federal system called for in their Constitution.\"\n",

    "text": "\nAdel, IA (December 28, 2007) - Today during a campaign stop in Adel, IA, Sen. Joe Biden spoke about the continued importance of America's strategic relationship with Pakistan. The importance of this relationship became even clearer yesterday, after the tragic assassination of former Pakastani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto left the country in state of crisis.\n\"Yesterday's tragic events further highlight the need for foreign policy leadership, including a swift and decisive shift away from the failed policies of the Bush Administration,\" said Sen. Biden. \"I have been saying for some time now that Pakistan is the most dangerous nation on the planet. The next President will need to deal with Pakistan in a thoughtful and constructive manner.\n\"Whoever becomes our next commander in chief must also recognize that Pakistan has a large, moderate, secular majority. However, that moderate majority needs to have a voice in the system and an outlet with elections. If not, extremists could take power, just as they did in Iran after the Shah. But unlike Iran, Pakistan already has nuclear weapons. It is hard to imagine a greater nightmare than the world's second-largest Muslim nation becoming a failed state in fundamentalist hands, with nuclear weapons and a population larger than those of Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and North Korea combined.\n\"That's why I proposed two months ago a comprehensive new approach to Pakistan that included these three points: First, we must deal pro-actively with the current crisis by putting pressure on Musharraf and the generals whose support he needs to hold fair elections as soon as possible. Second, in the long term, America needs to move from a Musharraf policy to a Pakistan policy that gives the moderate majority a chance to succeed. This change includes tripling non-military aid. That aid would be guaranteed for the next 10 years without conditions. I would also provide an additional $1 billion \"democracy dividend\" to help civilian government deliver progress and condition military assistance on results against extremists. Finally, we must help create conditions in the region that maximize the chances of success to demonstrate we're serious about finishing the job in Afghanistan and to encourage Pakistan to take a harder line on extremists, not cut a deal with them.\n\"In the end, we must deepen our non-military commitment to a stable Pakistan. We need for the Pakistani people to see that we are committed to them, and not just the Pakistan military. Pakistan is a nuclear state - and we cannot allow it to fail.\"\n",

Biden's grassroots support in Iowa will catapult him to success on caucus night, Sen. Biden began his final campaign swing through the Hawkeye State with a rally of over 200 supporters in Des Moines on Wednesday night and packed events in Corydon, Creston, and Council Bluffs yesterday. Over the next week, Mo-Joe '08 will sweep across Iowa, with Sen. Biden set to attend over 30 rallies in 28 counties statewide.\nOver the last week, there have been growing reports that an upset may be in the works, as Sen. Biden increasingly appears to be the dark horse poised to break through on January 3rd.\nLast week, Sen. Biden garnered two more legislative endorsements in Iowa, Rep. Eric Palmer of Oskaloosa and Rep. Dennis Cohoon of Burlington, bringing his tally of state legislative endorsements to 16. Sen. Biden's legislative support in Iowa also includes most members of the Democratic House Leadership. He currently ranks third in state legislative support behind Sens. Clinton and Obama, but has outpaced former Sen. John Edwards and the rest of his Democratic rivals.\nSen. Biden has been further bolstered by an impressive array of local elected officials in Iowa who have pledged to organize his support on caucus night. In fact, Sen. Biden's organized support statewide has led his rivals to privately acknowledge \"substantial pockets of support for Biden.\" [AP, 12/21/07]\nSen. Biden also earned endorsements from two Iowa newspapers last week, the Sheldon Northwestern Iowa Review and the Jefferson Herald. The Jefferson Herald Editorial Board wrote, \"We're frankly more comfortable with Senator Biden's readiness to lead than with any other candidate for President in either party.\" The Sheldon Northwestern Iowa Review underscored Sen. Biden's \"comfortable, distinguished understanding of foreign policy,\" and \"ability to work in a bipartisan spirit,\" and called him \"honest, hardworking and committed to the country.\" [Jefferson Herald, 12/20/07], [Sheldon Northwestern Iowa Review, 12/22/07]\nAnd with three new TV ads up on the air in Iowa over the last month—including the most recent \"Office\" ad released yesterday—Sen. Biden has kept pace with the frontrunners' air time over the last month of the race.\n\"Having moved solidly into fourth place in the most recent poll, Sen. Biden's growing momentum has become hard to ignore,\" said Biden for President Campaign Manager, Luis Navarro. \"While other candidates are seeing their support slip, Sen. Biden continues to move ahead as the candidate Iowans trust to lead America from Day One in the White House and the Democrat with the best chance to beat Republicans in 2008.\"\n",

    "text": "\nFt. Dodge, IA (December 31, 2007) - Osama Bin Laden sent a new message to his followers over the weekend. In it, he tried to rally support by claiming that the United States wants to control Iraq's oil and to build permanent military bases in Iraq to dominate the region. Bin Laden claimed, \"America seeks, alongside its agents in the region, to create an allied government ... that would accept in advance the presence of major U.S. bases in Iraq and give the Americans all they wish of Iraq's oil.\" [Washington Post, 12/29/07]\nFor two years, Sen. Joe Biden has led the effort to put Congress on record that the United States will not build permanent military bases in Iraq and does not seek to control its oil. As a result, none of the funding that Congress gave to the President for Iraq last year could be used for those purposes.\nSen. Biden has repeatedly pressed President Bush to clearly state U.S. policy in order to dispel the widespread belief in Iraq and across the Middle East that the United States intends to build permanent bases and to control Iraq's energy resources. The President has refused to make a clear statement of U.S. policy. For example, the Defense Authorization bill he vetoed this week included a provision barring the construction of permanent U.S. bases that Senator Biden originated.\nSen. Biden issued the following statement:\n\"The President's failure to make it clear that we will not build permanent military bases in Iraq and do not seek to control its oil, has handed Bin Laden a huge propaganda tool that allows him to enlist new recruits and makes the world more dangerous. President Bush has steadfastly refused to heed my call on this critical issue as seen in his veto of the Defense bill that included my language that the United States will have no permanent military bases in Iraq.\n\"I call on the President to state clearly and unequivocally, once and for all, that the United States will not build permanent military bases in Iraq and does not seek to control Iraq's oil. With each passing day, the American people witness the negative consequences of this White House's failed diplomacy. It is time for a change in Washington.\"\nBiden Sponsored Amendment to Bar Permanent Bases in Iraq. In May 2006 and again in August 2006, Senator Biden sponsored an amendment that was agreed to in the Senate by voice vote. The first provided \"that no funds made available by title I of this Act may be made available to establish permanent United States military bases in Iraq or to exercise control by the United States over the oil infrastructure or oil resources of Iraq.\" [S.AMDT.3855, agreed to in Senate by voice vote on 5/3/06; S.AMDT.4423, agreed to in Senate by unanimous consent on 6/22/06; S.AMDT.4851, agreed to in Senate by unanimous consent on 8/3/06]\nThe Washington Post reported, \"The Senate also approved by voice vote an amendment by Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) putting the chamber on record as opposing permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq and U.S. control of the country's natural resources.\" [Washington Post, 5/4/06]\nAccording to Army Times, \"The Senate approved an amendment to the 2007 defense appropriations bill sponsored by Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., barring U.S. government funds from being used to establish any facility in Iraq for permanent stationing of U.S. armed forces or exercise U.S. control over Iraqi oil resources.\" [Army Times, August 2006]\n",

Members of the committee, who include Democratic Party activists and community leaders from across Nevada, will help the campaign organize throughout the state leading up to the Nevada caucuses on January 19th.\nCatherine Jackson, a member of the committee, asked about how the candidates would get troops out of Iraq as she stood next to her son, an Iraq veteran, at the CNN Las Vegas Debate. Afterwards, she decided to publicly support Sen. Biden, saying, \"Joe Biden stands for integrity. When he shook my hand at the Las Vegas debate and told me his son was on notice to be deployed to Iraq, I was impressed that he cared and knew how I felt. I am supporting Joe Biden because I know he won't settle for anything less than our troops deserve, and will get them out of Iraq as soon as possible.\"\nIn anticipation of surging into the top tier in the Iowa caucuses this week, Biden for President Nevada State Director Ronni Council and Deputy State Director Omar Khan have traveled to the Hawkeye State for the final campaign push. They also launched a blog, \"Vegas Bets on Iowa,\" to chronicle their trip and the growing momentum behind Sen. Biden in Iowa for supporters back in Nevada.\n\"Having moved into fourth place in Iowa in recent polls, it's clear that caucus-goers are increasingly choosing Joe Biden as the best candidate for the job,\" said Biden for President Nevada State Director Ronni Council. \"And as our campaign continues to pick up steam in Nevada, we are confident as ever that by beating expectations on January 3rd and January 19th we can build the support we need to win the Democratic nomination.\"\n",

    "text": "\nI want to say I truly regret that words I spoke offended people I admire.\nI'm humbled that so many of these same people, as well as you in this room, viewed those words through the prism of my history and my heart. For that I'll be forever grateful.\nThis Administration has dug us into a very deep hole:\nAmerica is more isolated.\nAnd Americans are more uncertain about their future than any time in the last half century.\nThe American people are looking for someone to guide us through the difficult decade ahead;\nWho understands the problems and pressures facing the middle class.\nThey are looking for someone to help restore America's greatness.\nIn Iraq, the President took us to war unnecessarily.\nWithout letting the weapons inspectors finish their work...\nWithout enough troops.\nWithout the right equipment for the troops we sent or care for the veterans who returned...\nAnd, most of all, without a plan -- any plan.\nThe price of that failure can be measured in the blood we have shed and the treasure we have lost.\n3,067 dead.\nMore than 23,000 wounded.\nAnd over $350 billion committed to a war with no end in sight.\nMy fellow Democrats, we must end this war.\nTo stop the sectarian cycle of revenge in Iraq, we must first separate the combatants and give them a political way forward.\nI have a plan to do just that.\nGive the factions breathing room in their own regions with control over their local police.\nAnd over the fabric of their daily lives: education - marriage -- jobs.\nGive the central government responsibility for borders, currency and the army.\nGuarantee the Sunnis their fair share of oil revenues.\nDraw down our troops -- don't escalate -- forcing Iraq's leaders to reach a political settlement.\nAnd make Iraq the world's problem by having the U.N. convene a conference of the world's major powers to insist that Iraq's neighbors support that settlement.\nMr. President, your surge is not a solution --\nIt is a tragic mistake.\nAnd I am doing everything in my power to stop it.\nMr.. President, the majority of Americans oppose you on Iraq. We are not emboldening the enemy.\nThat's the one mission you have accomplished.\nAt this moment in our history, Americans need a leader with a breadth and depth of experience in world affairs.\nThis president will leave the next one with no margin for error. The next president will have to end the war in Iraq and immediately turn to other simmering hot spots before they explode.\nHere at home, it will not be enough for the next president to have the right plans.\nThe American people must believe that our nominee understands what they've been dealing with in their daily lives the last 6 years.\nThey know we need an energy policy to free us from the axis of oil and begin to reverse global warming.\nBut they don't believe that Washington understands just how hard it is to heat their home, or fill up their tank.\nI understand because I remember. I remember being a kid and answering the door when the bill collector came to shut off the electricity and telling him my mother wasn't home.\nAmericans know we need national health care.\nBut they doubt Washington understands what it feels like to lie in bed, like 47 million Americans without health insurance, looking over at your pregnant wife, and wondering what happens if your baby is premature. Will I lose my home?\nI understand because I remember being rolled into a operating room 20 years ago, after they told me that my chances weren't good, but thanking God that at least my family wouldn't be left in debt because I had insurance.\nAmericans know that a college degree is a ticket to the middle class.\nBut they wonder whether Washington understands what it feels like for a father or mother to look in the eyes of their child knowing there is no way to pay to help them get there.\nI understand because I remember. I remember my father's face as he was refused a bank loan to send me to college.\nI understand, like many of you in this room, these struggles and aspirations of the American people.\nBecause they are ours.\nThey represent our values.\nAmerica's values.\nAnd I will fight with every fiber in my being to keep America focused on the values that unite us, rather than the wedge issues used to divide us.\nThe American people are ready. And so am I.\nFor not once in our history have the American people let their country down.\nIt has been the historic role of the Democratic Party...\nFrom Jefferson to Jackson.\nRoosevelt to Clinton.\nTo remind America of that legacy, to summon us to the moment, to make America, once again, the light of the world.\nAnd, I pledge to you, as your President that will be what I do.\nGod Bless America.\nAnd, God Bless our troops.\n",

    "text": "\nWell, it's great to be here! On the steps of the old State House in the land of Lincoln. President Lincoln once instructed us to be sure to put your feet in the right place. Then stand firm. Today, Springfield, I know my feet are in the right place. And I am proud to stand firm for the next president of the United States of America, Barack Obama. Folks, Barack and I come from very different places, but we share a common story. An American story. He was the son of a single mom, a single mom who had to struggle to support her son and her kids. But she raised him. She raised him to believe in America. to believe that in this country there is no obstacle that could keep you from your dreams. If you are willing to work hard and fight for it. I was different. I was an Irish-Catholic kid from Scranton with a father who like many of yours in tough economic times fell on hard times, but my mom and dad raised me to believe, it's a saying Barack you heard me say before, my dad repeated it and repeated it. Said champ, it's not how many times you get knocked down, it's how quickly you get up. It's how quickly you get up. Ladies and gentlemen, that's your story. That's America's story. It's about if you get up, you can make it.\nThat's the America Barack Obama and I believe in. That's the American dream. And ladies and gentlemen, is there no ordinary times, and this is no ordinary election. Because the truth of the matter is, and you know it, that American dream under eight years of Bush and McCain, that American dream is slipping away. I don't have to tell you that. You feel it in your lives. You see it in your shrinking wages, and the cost of everything from groceries to health care to college to filling up your car at the gas station. It keeps going up and up and up, and the future keeps receding further and further and further away as you reach for your dreams. You know, ladies and gentlemen, it is not a mere political saying. I say with every fiber of my being I believe we cannot as a nation stand for four more years of this. We cannot afford to keep giving tax cuts after tax cuts to big corporations and the wealthiest Americans while the middle class America, middle class families are falling behind and their wages are actually shrinking. We can't afford four more years of a government that does nothing while they watch the housing market collapse. As you know, it's not just the millions of people facing foreclosure. It's the tens of millions of your neighbors who are seeing the values of their homes drop off a cliff along with their dreams.\nLadies and gentlemen, your kitchen table is like mine. You sit there at night before you put the kids -- after you put the kids to bed and you talk, you talk about what you need. You talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills. Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's not a worry John McCain has to worry about. It's a pretty hard experience. He'll have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at. Folks, again, it's not political sloganary when I say we literally can't afford four more years of this non-energy policy written by and for the oil companies, making us more and more dependent from hostile nations on our ability to run this country and literally, not figuratively, literally putting America's security at risk, we can't afford four more years of a foreign policy that has shredded our alliances and sacrificed our moral standing around the world.\nLadies and gentlemen, that's the bad news. But there is good news, America. We don't have to have four more years of George W. Bush. And John McCain. The next President of the United States is going to be delivered to the most significant moment in American history since Franklin Roosevelt. He will have such an incredible opportunity, incredible opportunity, not only to change the direction of America, but literally, literally to change the direction of the world. Barack Obama and I believe, we believe with every fiber in our being that our families, our communities as Americans, there's not a single solitary challenge we cannot face if we level with the American people. And I don't say that to say it; history, history has shown it. When have Americans ever, ever, ever, let their country down when they've had a leader to lead them?\nLadies and gentlemen, we believe that our tomorrows will be better than our yesterdays, and we believe we'll pass on to our children an even better life than the one we lived. That literally has been the American way, and it can be that way again. But there's a big, missing piece. The missing piece is leadership.\nIn all my time in the United States Senate, and I want you to know there's only four senators senior to me, but Barack, there's still 44 older than me. I want you to know that part. But all kidding aside, of all my years in the Senate, I have never in my life seen Washington so broken. I have never seen so many dreams denied and so many decisions deferred by politicians who are trying like the devil to escape their responsibility and accountability. But, ladies and gentlemen, the reckoning is now. And the reality, the reality is that we must answer the call or we will risk the harshest version and verdict of history. These times call for a total change in Washington's worldview. These times require more than a good soldier. They require a wise leader. A leader -- a leader who can deliver. A leader who can deliver the change we need.\nI'll say straight up to you - John McCain and the press knows this, is genuinely a friend of mine. I've known John for 35 years. He served our country with extraordinary courage and I know he wants to do right by America. But the harsh truth is, ladies and gentlemen, you can't change America when you boast. And these are John's words, quote, the most important issues of our day, I've been totally in agreement and support of President Bush. Ladies and gentlemen, that's what he said. You can't change America when you supported George Bush's policies 95% of the time. You can't change America when you believe, and these are his own words, that in the Bush administration we've made great progress economically. You can't change America and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to Bush's scheme of privatizing social security. You can't change America and give our workers a fighting chance when after 3 million manufacturing jobs disappear, you continue to support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas. You can't change America and end this war in Iraq when you declare and, again, these are John's words, no one has supported President Bush in Iraq more than I have, end of quote. Ladies and gentlemen, you can't change America, you can't change America when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of George Bush's presidency.\nMy friends -- yes, we can. My friends, I don't have to tell you, this election year the choice is clear. One man stands ready to deliver change we desperately need. A man I'm proud to call my friend. A man who will be the next president of the United States, Barack Amer -\nYou know, you learn a lot of things being up close with a guy. Let me tell you about Obama. You learn a lot about a man when you campaign with him. When you debate him 12 or 13 times. When you hear him speak. When you see how he thinks. And you watch how he reacts under pressure. You learn a lot about his strength of his mind, and I think even more importantly, the quality of his heart. Ladies and gentlemen, no one knows better than I do that presidential campaigns are crucibles in which you're tested and challenged every single day. And over the past 18 months, I've watched Barack meet those challenges with judgment, intelligence, and steel in his spine. I've watched as he's inspired millions of Americans, millions of Americans to this new cause.\nAnd during those 18 months, I must tell you, frankly, I've been disappointed in my friend, John McCain, who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swiftboat politics that he so -- once so deplored. And folks, campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership. And in this campaign, one candidate, one candidate has passed that test.\nBarack has the vision, and what you can't forget, you know his vision, but let me tell you something. He also has the courage, the courage to make this a better place, and let me tell you something else, this man is a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done. I watch with amazement as he came to the Senate. I watch with amazement. He made his mark literally from day one reaching across the aisle to pass legislation to secure the world's deadliest weapons, standing up to some of the most entrenched interests in Washington, risking the wrath of the old order to pass the most sweeping ethics reform in a generation. But I was proudest, I was proudest, when I watched him spontaneously focus the attention of the nation on the shameful neglect of America's wounded warriors at Walter Reed Army Hospital. Ladies and gentlemen, I know I'm told I talk too colloquially, but there's something about this guy. There's something about this guy. There's something about Barack Obama that allows him to bring people together like no one I have worked with and seen. There's something about Barack Obama that makes people understand if they make compromises they can make things better.\nIt's been amazing to watch him. But then again, that's been the story of his whole life. I end where I began. This is a man raised by a single mother who sometimes was on food stamps as she worked to put herself through school, by grandparents from the prairies of Kansas who loved him, a grandfather, a grandfather who marched in Paton's Army and then came home and went to college on the G.I. Bill, and a grandmother, a grandmother with just a high school education, started off working in a small bank in the secretarial pool and rose to be vice president of that bank. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, these remarkable people gave Barack Obama the determination and drive, and, yes, the values to turn down that big job on Wall Street, to come to Chicago's south side, where he helped workers help themselves after the steel mills had been shut down and the jobs disappeared.\nLadies and gentlemen, my wife Jill, who you'll meet soon, is drop dead gorgeous. My wife Jill, who you'll meet soon, she also has her doctorate degree, which is a problem. But all kidding aside, my Jill, my Jill, my wife Jill and I are honored to join Barack and Michelle on this journey, because that's what it is. it's a journey. We share the same values, the values that we had passed on to us by our parents and the values Jill and I are passing on to our sons Beau and Hunter and Ashley.\nLadies and gentlemen, I'm here for their future. I'm here for the future of your kids. I'm here for everyone I - I'm here for everyone I grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, who's been forgotten and everybody in Claymont, Delaware, in Wilmington where I lived. I'm here for the cops and the fire fighters, the teachers and the line workers, the folks who live - the folks whose lives are the measure of whether the American dream endures.\nLadies and gentlemen, this is no ordinary time. This is no ordinary election. And this may be our last chance to reclaim the America we love, to restore America's soul. Ladies and gentlemen, America gave Jill and me our chance. It gave Barack and Michelle their chance to stand on this stage today. It's literally incredible. These values, this country gave us that chance. And now it's time for all of us, as Lincoln said, to put our feet in the right place and to stand firm. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to elect Barack Obama president. It's our time. It's America's time. God bless America, and may he protect our troops.\n",

    "text": "\nBeau, I love you. I am so proud of you. Proud of the son you are. Proud of the father you've become. And I'm so proud of my son Hunter, my daughter Ashley, and my wife Jill, the only one who leaves me breathless and speechless at the same time.\nIt is an honor to share this stage tonight with President Clinton. And last night, it was moving to watch Hillary, one of the great leaders of our party, a woman who has made history and will continue to make history: my colleague and my friend, Senator Hillary Clinton.\nAnd I am honored to represent our first state--my state--Delaware.\nSince I've never been called a man of few words, let me say this as simply as I can: Yes. Yes, I accept your nomination to run and serve alongside our next President of the United States of America, Barack Obama.\nLet me make this pledge to you right here and now. For every American who is trying to do the right thing, for all those people in government who are honoring their pledge to uphold the law and respect our Constitution, no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the English language be: \"The vice president's office is on the phone.\"\nBarack Obama and I took very different journeys to this destination, but we share a common story. Mine began in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and then Wilmington, Delaware. With a dad who fell on hard economic times, but who always told me: \"Champ, when you get knocked down, get up. Get up.\"\nI wish that my dad was here tonight, but I am so grateful that my mom, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, is here. You know, she taught her children--all the children who flocked to our house--that you are defined by your sense of honor, and you are redeemed by your loyalty. She believes bravery lives in every heart and her expectation is that it will be summoned.\nFailure at some point in everyone's life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable. As a child I stuttered, and she lovingly told me it was because I was so bright I couldn't get the thoughts out quickly enough. When I was not as well dressed as others, she told me how handsome she thought I was. When I got knocked down by guys bigger than me, she sent me back out and demanded that I bloody their nose so I could walk down that street the next day.\nAfter the accident, she told me, \"Joey, God sends no cross you cannot bear.\" And when I triumphed, she was quick to remind me it was because of others.\nMy mother's creed is the American creed: No one is better than you. You are everyone's equal, and everyone is equal to you.\nMy parents taught us to live our faith, and treasure our family. We learned the dignity of work, and we were told that anyone can make it if they try.\nThat was America's promise. For those of us who grew up in middle-class neighborhoods like Scranton and Wilmington, that was the American dream and we knew it.\nBut today that American dream feels as if it's slowly slipping away. I don't need to tell you that. You feel it every single day in your own lives.\nI've never seen a time when Washington has watched so many people get knocked down without doing anything to help them get back up. Almost every night, I take the train home to Wilmington, sometimes very late. As I look out the window at the homes we pass, I can almost hear what they're talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed.\nLike millions of Americans, they're asking questions as profound as they are ordinary. Questions they never thought they would have to ask:\n  •  Should mom move in with us now that dad is gone?  •  Fifty, sixty, seventy dollars to fill up the car?  •  Winter's coming. How we gonna pay the heating bills?  •  Another year and no raise?  •  Did you hear the company may be cutting our health care?  •  Now, we owe more on the house than it's worth. How are we going to send the kids to college?  •  How are we gonna be able to retire?\nThat's the America that George Bush has left us, and that's the future John McCain will give us. These are not isolated discussions among families down on their luck. These are common stories among middle-class people who worked hard and played by the rules on the promise that their tomorrows would be better than their yesterdays.\nThat promise is the bedrock of America. It defines who we are as a people. And now it's in jeopardy. I know it. You know it. But John McCain doesn't get it.\nBarack Obama gets it. Like many of us, Barack worked his way up. His is a great American story.\nYou know, I believe the measure of a man isn't just the road he's traveled; it's the choices he's made along the way. Barack Obama could have done anything after he graduated from college. With all his talent and promise, he could have written his ticket to Wall Street. But that's not what he chose to do. He chose to go to Chicago. The South Side. There he met men and women who had lost their jobs. Their neighborhood was devastated when the local steel plant closed. Their dreams deferred. Their dignity shattered. Their self-esteem gone.\nAnd he made their lives the work of his life. That's what you do when you've been raised by a single mom, who worked, went to school and raised two kids on her own. That's how you come to believe, to the very core of your being, that work is more than a paycheck. It's dignity. It's respect. It's about whether you can look your children in the eye and say: we're going to be ok.\nBecause Barack made that choice, 150,000 more children and parents have health care in Illinois. He fought to make that happen. And because Barack made that choice, working families in Illinois pay less taxes and more people have moved from welfare to the dignity of work. He got it done.\nAnd when he came to Washington, I watched him hit the ground running, leading the fight to pass the most sweeping ethics reform in a generation. He reached across party lines to pass a law that helps keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists. And he moved Congress and the president to give our wounded veterans the care and dignity they deserve.\nYou can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him, debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure. You learn about the strength of his mind, but even more importantly, you learn about the quality of his heart.\nI watched how he touched people, how he inspired them, and I realized he has tapped into the oldest American belief of all: We don't have to accept a situation we cannot bear.\nWe have the power to change it. That's Barack Obama, and that's what he will do for this country. He'll change it.\nJohn McCain is my friend. We've known each other for three decades. We've traveled the world together. It's a friendship that goes beyond politics. And the personal courage and heroism John demonstrated still amaze me.\nBut I profoundly disagree with the direction that John wants to take the country. For example,\nJohn thinks that during the Bush years \"we've made great progress economically.\" I think it's been abysmal.\nAnd in the Senate, John sided with President Bush 95 percent of the time. Give me a break. When John McCain proposes $200 billion in new tax breaks for corporate America, $1 billion alone for just eight of the largest companies, but no relief for 100 million American families, that's not change; that's more of the same.\nEven today, as oil companies post the biggest profits in history--a half trillion dollars in the last five years--he wants to give them another $4 billion in tax breaks. But he voted time and again against incentives for renewable energy: solar, wind, biofuels. That's not change; that's more of the same.\nMillions of jobs have left our shores, yet John continues to support tax breaks for corporations that send them there. That's not change; that's more of the same.\nHe voted 19 times against raising the minimum wage. For people who are struggling just to get to the next day, that's not change; that's more of the same.\nAnd when he says he will continue to spend $10 billion a month in Iraq when Iraq is sitting on a surplus of nearly $80 billion, that's not change; that's more of the same.\nThe choice in this election is clear. These times require more than a good soldier; they require a wise leader, a leader who can deliver change--the change everybody knows we need.\nBarack Obama will deliver that change. Barack Obama will reform our tax code. He'll cut taxes for 95 percent of the American people who draw a paycheck. That's the change we need.\nBarack Obama will transform our economy by making alternative energy a genuine national priority, creating 5 million new jobs and finally freeing us from the grip of foreign oil. That's the change we need.\nBarack Obama knows that any country that out teaches us today will out-compete us tomorrow. He'll invest in the next generation of teachers. He'll make college more affordable. That's the change we need.\nBarack Obama will bring down health care costs by $2,500 for the typical family, and, at long last, deliver affordable, accessible health care for all Americans. That's the change we need.\nBarack Obama will put more cops on the streets, put the \"security\" back in Social Security and never give up until we achieve equal pay for women. That's the change we need.\nAs we gather here tonight, our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out. For the last seven years, this administration has failed to face the biggest forces shaping this century: the emergence of Russia, China and India as great powers; the spread of lethal weapons; the shortage of secure supplies of energy, food and water; the challenge of climate change; and the resurgence of fundamentalism in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the real central front against terrorism.\nIn recent days, we've once again seen the consequences of this neglect with Russia's challenge to the free and democratic country of Georgia. Barack Obama and I will end this neglect. We will hold Russia accountable for its actions, and we'll help the people of Georgia rebuild.\nI've been on the ground in Georgia, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and I can tell you in no uncertain terms: this Administration's policy has been an abject failure. America cannot afford four more years of this.\nNow, despite being complicit in this catastrophic foreign policy, John McCain says Barack Obama isn't ready to protect our national security. Now, let me ask you: whose judgment should we trust? Should we trust John McCain's judgment when he said only three years ago, \"Afghanistan--we don't read about it anymore because it's succeeded\"? Or should we trust Barack Obama, who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to Afghanistan?\nThe fact is, al-Qaida and the Taliban--the people who actually attacked us on 9/11--have regrouped in those mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan and are plotting new attacks. And the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff echoed Barack's call for more troops.\nJohn McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.\nShould we trust John McCain's judgment when he rejected talking with Iran and then asked: What is there to talk about? Or Barack Obama, who said we must talk and make it clear to Iran that its conduct must change.\nNow, after seven years of denial, even the Bush administration recognizes that we should talk to Iran, because that's the best way to advance our security.\nAgain, John McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.\nShould we trust John McCain's judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from Iraq--that we must stay indefinitely? Or should we listen to Barack Obama, who says shift responsibility to the Iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home?\nNow, after six long years, the Bush administration and the Iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home.\nJohn McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.\nAgain and again, on the most important national security issues of our time, John McCain was wrong, and Barack Obama was proven right.\nFolks, remember when the world used to trust us? When they looked to us for leadership? With Barack Obama as our president, they'll look to us again, they'll trust us again, and we'll be able to lead again.\nJill and I are truly honored to join Barack and Michelle on this journey. When I look at their young children--and when I look at my grandchildren--I realize why I'm here. I'm here for their future.\nAnd I am here for everyone I grew up with in Scranton and Wilmington. I am here for the cops and firefighters, the teachers and assembly line workers--the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the American dream endures.\nOur greatest presidents--from Abraham Lincoln to Franklin Roosevelt to John Kennedy--they all challenged us to embrace change. Now, it's our responsibility to meet that challenge.\nMillions of Americans have been knocked down. And this is the time as Americans, together, we get back up. Our people are too good, our debt to our parents and grandparents too great, our obligation to our children is too sacred.\nThese are extraordinary times. This is an extraordinary election. The American people are ready. I'm ready. Barack Obama is ready. This is his time. This is our time. This is America's time.\nMay God bless America and protect our troops.\n",

    "text": "\nMR. BROKAW: Welcome back to MEET THE PRESS. It's, by our account, your 42nd appearance here. You were here...\nSEN. JOE BIDEN (D-DE): First one, first one in Delaware. Thanks for coming up, Tom.\nMR. BROKAW: Well, you were, you were here earlier this summer saying you would accept, but you didn't necessarily want the vice presidential nomination at that time.\nSEN. BIDEN: Well, I told you exactly what I thought, and it was true. I, I was very satisfied in the job I had as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and I thought I could help the ticket that way. And--but Barack asked me to do it and I had committed to him, and if he wanted me--whatever he wanted me to do, I'd do, because I think this election is so critical.\nMR. BROKAW: Let's talk about this past week.\nSEN. BIDEN: Yeah.\nMR. BROKAW: You and I were just watching Sarah Palin...\nSEN. BIDEN: Yeah.\nMR. BROKAW: ...with that very impressive introductory appearance that she made...\nSEN. BIDEN: Yeah.\nMR. BROKAW: ...at the Republican National Convention. And when she used that line, being a mayor is like being a community organizer except you have actual responsibilities, you said, \"Pretty good line.\"\nSEN. BIDEN: Yeah, it was a great line.\nMR. BROKAW: She had a number of good lines.\nSEN. BIDEN: She had a number of good ones. Look, she's a smart, tough politician, and so I, I think she's going to be very formidable. But you know, eventually she's going to have to sit in front of you like I'm doing and have done. Eventually she's going to have to answer questions and not be sequestered. Eventually she's going to have to answer questions about her record.\nMR. BROKAW: Who was the first person you called after the speech?\nSEN. BIDEN: After my speech?\nMR. BROKAW: After her speech.\nSEN. BIDEN: I didn't call anybody. I didn't--I happened to be--I didn't get her--I didn't see her speech, I saw part of it. I--we were, we were flying to--from Florida to Virginia, and I caught the tail end of it. And--oh, I guess I--actually, I called my wife. I called my wife.\nMR. BROKAW: And what did she say?\nSEN. BIDEN: She said she thought she was tough. She thought she was tough and she was a good politician. And so, you know, but who knows where this is going to go. You know, it's early in the process and the voters are going to make judgments about Sarah Palin and Joe Biden, and--but the truth is they're mostly going to make judgments about Barack Obama and John McCain. Vice presidents are useful, but we're not, we're not determinative.\nMR. BROKAW: Already people are saying no one has a tougher job in the base than Joe Biden. He has to go up against this woman and she has been teed up, in many ways, by the Republican Party as someone that you just can't go after...\nSEN. BIDEN: Yeah.\nMR. BROKAW: ...in conventional terms. Make it tougher debating her than it would, say, Mitt Romney or Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania?\nSEN. BIDEN: Well, in, in the sense I know Mitt Romney and know his positions, and I know Tom Ridge and I really respect them. And--but you know, I, I've debated an awful lot of tough, smart women. A woman who's a judge here in our superior court was one of my toughest opponents ever for the Senate. And there's a lot of very tough, smart women in the United States Senate I debate every day. So in that sense it's not new. But what is new is I have no idea what her policies are. I assume they're the same as John's. I just don't know.\nMR. BROKAW: She did get off to a very fast start the day after they left St. Paul. They were out in Wisconsin, at Cedarburg, Wisconsin. Here were just some of the signs. Huge lineup of women, some of them with their daughters. \"Wisconsin Loves Palin!\" \"Pro-Life Hockey Moms 4 Palin.\" \"Sarah Leaves Liberals Spinning.\" \"Read my Lipstick,\" that was a reference to her line, \"What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull,\" and she said, \"lipstick.\" And then we asked one of the women why she was at this debate and this was the response.\n(Videotape)\nOffscreen Voice: What brought you out here today?\nUnidentified Woman: Sarah.\n(End videotape)\nMR. BROKAW: She's already so familiar to women that they're using her first name, Sarah. Does that give your ticket a problem, because there was a dust-up obviously between the Hillary Clinton supporters and the Obama campaign?\nSEN. BIDEN: Well look, I, I live with a lot of smart women. My wife is a professor and hard-working person. My daughter. You know, I think it's kind of demeaning to suggest that all women are going to vote for a woman just because she's a woman even when she's diametrically opposed to everything Hillary stands for. I mean, I hear this talk about, you know, is she going to pick up Hillary voters? Well, I--so far I haven't heard one single policy position, one single position that she has in common with Hillary. So I, I just think, you know, all folks are a little more discriminating than just merely whether or not it's the same sex or the same ethnicity or whatever. But we'll see, we'll see. The truth is, I don't know.\nMR. BROKAW: I want to move on in a moment, but there's another headline that appeared in the New York Post. Oprah Winfrey decided not to have Sarah Palin on the show before the election. \"No-Prah!\" That's the New York Post headline. \"TV first lady's Palin insult,\" as they called it. Oprah did come out for Barack Obama, did have him on the show. Do you think that some people will see that as an elitist position, that in some ways Democrats may be afraid of her, Sarah Palin?\nSEN. BIDEN: Oh, no, I don't think so. I mean, I think it's--well, I don't--look, that's for voters to decide. You're not going to see anything elitist--look, what you hear immediately from Barack Obama and Joe Biden, families off-limits and we mean it, that the personal stuff relating to some of the stuff that was popping out on, on the talk shows is just inappropriate. She's going to be judged, I assume, the same way I'm going to be judged. What does she know, what does she think, what's her record, what's she going to do? And as I look down the road, that's how I've always debated whoever I've debated, including the really tough women I work with, smart women, in the Senate. So I, I, I really don't view this any differently. I may be surprised here down the road. But, but, you know, I'm just looking forward to debating her. I mean, why--look, she had a great speech. But what was--her silence on the issues was deafening. She didn't mention a word about healthcare, a word about the environment, a word about the middle class. They never parted her lips. I mean, so I don't know where she is on those things.\nMR. BROKAW: Let's talk about the polls, if we can for a moment.\nSEN. BIDEN: Sure.\nMR. BROKAW: I think we're at the end of stage three of a long campaign for president. You have candidates who announced, then you had the primaries, then you have the convention, then you have the debates and then you have the runoff which leads to the election. Here's what happened last week according to the Gallup Poll. We're going to show you the tracking that went on. On Monday, you had about a six-point lead over John McCain. It went to an eight-point lead by Tuesday. But then it began to tighten up and by the time you got to Saturday, it was just two points separating the two of them. So it's fair to say, I think, that the Republicans got the bounce out of this convention that they wanted to get.\nSEN. BIDEN: Oh, I, I think we got the bounce and they got the bounce and then it ended up right where it was before. Look, Barack and I have never thought this was going to be anything other than a close election down to the wire. This is going to get down to, you know, I think we're going to be--you're going to be sitting up very late at night deciding...\nMR. BROKAW: I've done it before.\nSEN. BIDEN: I know you have. I hope--hopefully, you're not going to be in a position where we're going to be recounting anything. But look, I--we've assumed from the beginning this is going to be a close, tough race. This is a historic race. You have not only in terms of the candidates, but the time. You said before the--if you don't mind me saying, we were sitting here, you said, \"Look, John McCain had this gigantic number of people watching. Barack had 38 and he had 39 million or whatever it was,\" but more than ever watched a convention. People are focused, man. Their lives, as they view it, their standing in the middle class, their standing in the world, depends on it. So I think this is going to be a very focused election.\nMR. BROKAW: Will you send Hillary Clinton into those working class states that she won and where there are a lot of independents or the so-called Reagan Democrats who have not made up their minds, states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Indiana, will she be a big player for this campaign for your candidacy in those states?\nSEN. BIDEN: Well, I think she is a big player, and you know, as a matter of fact, I hope I'll be campaigning with her in some of those states, particularly in Pennsylvania and Ohio. She's indicated she's prepared to do it. Bill Clinton's indicated to me he's prepared to go anywhere and campaign with us. That's a process being worked out now, how to mechanically do that. But no, no, I think, I think Hillary's going to play a major role here. She's a major force in not only a Democratic Party, she's a major force in American politics.\nMR. BROKAW: Side by side with Barack Obama and you, or will they go independently?\nSEN. BIDEN: My guess is all three. My guess is we'll occasionally be side by side with me, with Barack, and I imagine independently as well.\nMR. BROKAW: As you know, earlier in the campaign, Barack Obama said that he would be willing to appear in town halls, a proposition put forth by John McCain, go around the country, appear two, three times a week in different venues, and then he decided not to. He wanted to confine it to just three debates. Those numbers that we just referred to, 38 million people watching Senator Obama, 39 million watching McCain, 38 million watching Governor Palin the other night, that is an indication this country is really tuned in in a way that I can't remember maybe since 1968. Why not have town halls? Why not have Senator Obama go head to head with John McCain across the country?\nSEN. BIDEN: Well, that's a little above my pay grade, to use the phrase. I mean, it's a decision the campaign made before I got on the campaign, before I was picked, but...\nMR. BROKAW: Do you think it's a good idea?\nSEN. BIDEN: But--no, I think, I think you're going to learn more from having--look, you just got finished pointing out how many people watched this. I think those debates that are going to take place, the three critical debates between the two nominees, are going to be the most watched debates in the history of American politics, and I think people are going to get everything they need out of those debates, plus they're going to have an opportunity to--look, another reason why, in my view--I can't speak for the campaign, because I haven't gotten into--I mean, I just got on the ticket--is that, you know, we have a different focus. For example, I'm headed to--we think we can win Montana. Now, you know, they'd like very much to not, not spend a lot of time in Montana and Virginia and another 12 states or so that were Republican states we think we can compete in and win. And so when you decide on doing, you know, a campaign, a town hall, you know, every week, what you do, you significantly constrain your ability to get to places where Democratic candidates haven't spent much time before.\nMR. BROKAW: Let's talk about some issues. Let's begin with Iraq if we can.\nSEN. BIDEN: Yeah.\nMR. BROKAW: There was an enlightening exchange this past week between Senator Obama at the top of the ticket and Bill O'Reilly of Fox News, talking about the surge, which has been a point of contention in this debate. Bill O'Reilly said, \"Why can't you acknowledge that the surge was a success.\" Let's pick up some of that exchange, and just listen to it and have you react to it.\nSEN. BIDEN: Sure.\n(Videotape, Thursday)\nSEN. BARACK OBAMA (D-IL): Bill, what I've said is, I've already said, it succeeded beyond our wildest dreams, which is...\nMR. BILL O'REILLY: Right, so why can't you just say, \"I was right in the beginning and I was wrong about the surge\"?\nSEN. OBAMA: Because there is an underlying problem with what we've done. We have reduced the violence...\nMR. O'REILLY: Yeah.\nSEN. OBAMA: ...but the Iraqis still haven't taken responsibility, and we still don't have the kind of political reconciliation...\n(End videotape)\nMR. BROKAW: He is talking about political reconciliation, but he also said that it has succeeded beyond anyone's expectations. Here you were, just one year ago, on MEET THE PRESS. This was your take on the surge at that time, so let's listen to that, Senator. \"I mean, the truth of the matter is\" \"this administration's policy and the surge are a failure,\" you said, \"and that the surge, which was supposed to stop sectarian violence and - long enough to give political reconciliation, there has been no political reconciliation.\" Then you went on to say earlier in the year, \"General Petraeus believes that it is a good idea, the surge. He may be the only one who believes that. Virtually no one else believes it's a good idea.\" Well, at the time, John McCain did, and all the indications are the surge has worked up to a point. It's not a victory, as Senator Lindsey Graham said the other night...\nSEN. BIDEN: Or as John McCain said.\nMR. BROKAW: Or John McCain said, but the conditions are in place, and Anbar province, where you have been, where there had been so much difficulty, the Iraqis now have taken over that province. We have brigades that have Sunnis and Shia serving side by side...\nSEN. BIDEN: Not many.\nMR. BROKAW: ...fighting the terrorists. But it's a process, and it's beginning, and the surge made that possible, did it not?\nSEN. BIDEN: No. The surge helped make that--what made is possible in Anbar province is they did what I'd suggested two and a half years ago: gave local control. They turned over and they said to the Sunnis in Anbar province, \"We promise you, don't worry, you're not going to have any Shia in here. There's going to be no national forces in here. We're going to train your forces to help you fight al-Qaeda.\" And that you--what you had was the awakening. The awakening was not an awakening by us, it was an awakening of the Sunnis in Anbar province willing to fight.\nMR. BROKAW: Cooperating with the Shia.\nSEN. BIDEN: Willing to fight. Cooperating with--no, they weren't cooperating with Shiite. They didn't cooperate with the Shiites.\nMR. BROKAW: Once the awakening got under way.\nSEN. BIDEN: No, no, no. No, they didn't cooperate with the Shiites. It's still--it's a big problem, Tom. You got--we're paying 300 bucks a month to each of those guys. Now the problem has been and the, and the promise was made by Maliki that they would be integrated into the overall military. That's a process that is beginning in fits and starts now, but it's far from over. Far from--look, the bottom line here is that it's--let's--the surge is over. Here's the real point. Whether or not the surge worked is almost irrelevant now. We're in a new deal. What is the administration doing? They're doing what Barack Obama has suggested over 14 months ago, turn responsibility over and draw down our troops. We're about to get a deal from the president of the United States and Maliki, the head of the Iraqi government, that's going to land on my desk as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee saying we're going to set a timeline to draw down our forces. The only guy in America out of step is John McCain. John McCain's saying no timeline. They've signed on to Barack Obama's proposal.\nMR. BROKAW: But the surge helped make that timeline possible, did it not?\nSEN. BIDEN: Well, it did help make it possible. It did help. But it's not the reason. Look, they also--take a look at the analysis, Tom. They say the reason why there's such success against the, the insurgency is because of now small, very well trained counterinsurgency units. It's not the numbers, it's the type of units that are in there. What I was arguing about before was we have the wrong units in there. We have the wrong kind of force in there. We weren't focused on counterinsurgency.\nAnd so look--but, but, but the bottom line is we can argue about whether the surge was good, bad or indifferent. Let's assume it was all good. The truth of the matter is, what do we do now? What's John McCain going to do when he's president? He says he will not sign on to a timeline, number one. Number two, he has no, no idea, no suggestion how he's going to deal with the neighbors. He has no idea how he's going to deal with Iraq. He has no idea how he's going to deal with Syria. He has no idea how he's going to deal with Turkey. We have laid out a clear plan.\nMR. BROKAW: But two years ago you were the principal author, along with Les Gelb of the Council on Foreign Relations, of an entirely different kind of plan. You were promoting heavily the idea of a confederation, or a partition.\nSEN. BIDEN: That's exact--not, not a partition. You guys keep saying that. It was never a partition.\nMR. BROKAW: Or the--we'll make it a confederation.\nSEN. BIDEN: We--yeah, yeah. That's what it was. OK.\nMR. BROKAW: But the--but terms of real political terms, it would quickly become a partition.\nSEN. BIDEN: Not true. Absolutely, positively not true.\nMR. BROKAW: You think that the Kurds in the north and the, and the, and the Sunnis and the Shia would just say, \"Oh, we can all get across--get together across lines,\" without having a prescription...(unintelligible).\nSEN. BIDEN: No, no. That wasn't it. There was a central government that had power, but there was more power given to the localities like exist right now. Tom, tell me, what's changed up among, among the Kurds? You still not--cannot, under the Iraqi constitution, send an Iraqi army up there. You still not--cannot fly an Iraqi flag up there unless you get permission. Tell me what's happened in Anbar province. There are no Sunnis in Anbar province--I mean, Shia in Anbar province. It is de facto exactly what I said. That's what's working. Everything that's working in Iraq has been the bottom up approach, not a strong central government imposing. And the truth of the matter is the only way you're going to make this--sustain it, the question is, how do we leave and leave a stable Iraq behind? Without a political settlement, Tom, we're going to be back there in another year or two or three or five.\nMR. BROKAW: But are you encouraged they're moving toward a political settlement?\nSEN. BIDEN: Yes, I am encouraged, because they're doing the things I suggested. They're localizing it, Tom. That's why it is moving toward some mild possibility of a resolution. And if you were to now follow up--if John McCain as president, would follow up like we will as president and say, \"OK, how do you get the rest of the neighborhood in the deal?\" How do you get, how do you get Iran and Syria to stop supporting the--specifically, the Shia? And every--you know, this talk about how this has been such a great success, look where we are now in the Middle East. You now have a Shia-dominated government close to Iran. What's Maliki do? When Ahmadinejad comes, he kisses him on both cheek and seeks permission. So give me a break about how this is such a great political success.\nWe have the bravest soldiers in the world. I said at the time of the surge, if we sent in 500,000 troops we could tamp this down immediately, shut it down and end all violence. But that would not solve the problem. What do we do when we leave? What's left behind? And that's the hard work, and that requires the region as well. And you don't hear a word from John about that--John McCain. You don't hear a word from Sarah Palin about that. But you do now from the administration. The administration's now signing on to Barack Obama's plan to set a timeline, to--not the exact plan, but to set a timeline to draw down American troops.\nMR. BROKAW: Five years from now, do you think Iraq will have relative stability and democratic principles in a central government?\nSEN. BIDEN: If there is an Obama-Biden administration, yeah. If there is a John McCain administration and Sarah Palin, I think it's probably not going to happen, because John does not view this in terms of the region. I never heard him speak about how he's going to integrate Iraq into the region where you have these competing interests that exist. And I, I, I just--now, John may have an idea. I've never heard it. I've never heard it. And by the way, that Biden proposal, 75 senators voted for it, including the majority of the Republican Party.\nMR. BROKAW: But the Iraqi government didn't like the idea. Maliki...\nSEN. BIDEN: Well, the Iraqi government--Maliki didn't, but the rest of the government liked it.\nMR. BROKAW: But he is the head of the government. It's their country.\nSEN. BIDEN: Yeah--by the way, it is their country, but he's the head of the government, but he's the head of the government whose popularity is very much in question, and the election itself. You had a whole lot of people--look, here's going to be the key, Tom. They're about to have regional elections. Let's see how they go. Let's see how the regional elections go. Pray God they'll go well for the sake of all of our sons that are there.\nMR. BROKAW: Let's move on to some domestic issues.\nSEN. BIDEN: Sure.\nMR. BROKAW: The country's waking up this morning to the news that the federal government's about to move in on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Those are quasi government agencies holding $5.3 trillion in mortgage debt. They're in serious trouble at the moment, but they're in a free fall, in effect. The government reorganized them, it appears that they're going to pump in some fresh capital on a quarterly basis, but shareholders will have their shares greatly diluted by this move. But the preferred shareholders--China and other governments that have invested in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--will not suffer, because the government will prop them up. Is that fair?\nSEN. BIDEN: Well, no, it's not fair, but I don't think that's what's going to happen. I talked to Secretary Paulson last night. I'm not at liberty to lay out what he told me, because he should announce it today. But there's three principles that have to play here for this to work, in my view. One, you have to make sure that you help homeowners and stabilize, at the same time, financial institutions. Secondly, you got to make sure that you're not bailing out shareholders vs. the taxpayers. And the third thing you got to do is make sure that they're still in a position to be able to continue to lend, because there is a need for them to continue to have this elasticity of being able to deal with the market. Now, what I've heard the outline of, I am--I want to wait till I see all the detail, but if it meets those three principles, then I think it has a great chance of succeeding. And as I understand it, whatever proposal Secretary Paulson is going to make is a proposal to get us over this hump of instability and uncertainty. It's not an official reorganization. It will be left to the next administration and the Congress to make those judgments.\nMR. BROKAW: All investors suffer equally?\nSEN. BIDEN: They should. They should. We'll see what the plan is.\nMR. BROKAW: We want to talk a little bit about both campaigns now describing themselves as an agent of change. Senator Obama has been hard on the case about Washington lobbyists and their influence. Let's share with you and our viewers just some of the ads and the statements that he's made about all of that, if we can.\n(Videotape, Yesterday)\nSEN. OBAMA: And suddenly, he's the change agent. He says, \"I'm going to tell those lobbyists that their days of running Washington are over.\" Who's he going to tell? Is he going to tell his campaign chairman, who's one of the biggest corporate lobbyists in Washington? Is he going to tell his campaign manager, who was one of the biggest corporate lobbyists in Washington? Who is it that he's going to tell that change is coming? I mean, come on. They must think you're stupid.\n(End videotape)\nMR. BROKAW: Now Senator Obama is out with an ad as well, pretty much the same theme. Let's listen to that, if we can.\n(Excerpt from political ad)\nSEN. OBAMA: I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message.\nBut America is listening, not just Democrats. The Republicans and independents who've lost trust in their government but want to believe again.\nI am in this race to tell the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda in Washington are over. I have done more than any other candidate in this race to take on the lobbyists and I have won. They have not funded my campaign and they will not drown out the voices of the American people when I am president.\n(End excerpt)\nMR. BROKAW: That is Senator Barack Obama during the primary campaign. He was campaigning in Iowa at the time. In your hometown newspaper this morning, there's a big headline, \"Banking on Biden.\" \"As the senator of Delaware's financial institutions find themselves banking on Biden. To some, Joe Biden's makeover as a blue collar warrior is slightly at odds with the blue blood company that he keeps in the corporate state. Not only is Biden a neighbor to wealthy and powerful company titans and DuPont family members, he's thrown his weight behind issues and legislation that benefitted Delaware's big banking interests.\" This is what The Wall Street Journal had to say about all of this. \"Obama's choice of Biden as his running mate is coming under fire from Republicans who are painting him as an old-style insider. They cite his longstanding ties to trial lawyers and lobbyists and a taste for pork-barrel spending...\n\"Biden ... had collected $6.5 million in campaign contributions from lobbyists, lawyers and law firms since 1989, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. ...\n\"Biden's candidacy also is bringing new scrutiny to his family's business dealings, especially those of his son Hunter, who is 38 years old.\" And that's a reference to your son being hired right out of law school by a big company here in Delaware that is in the credit card business, MBNA. He got about $100,000 a year, as I recall. You received $214,000 in campaign contributions from the company and from its employees. At the same time, you were fighting for a bankruptcy bill that MBNA really wanted to get passed through the Senate, making it much tougher for everyone to file bankruptcy. Senator Obama was opposed to the bill. Among other things you couldn't, in fact, claim that you had a problem because of big medical bills. You voted against an amendment that would call for a warning on predatory lending. You also called for--you opposed efforts to strengthen the protection of people in bankruptcy. This has been an issue that you're heard about before. Your son was working for the company at the same time. In retrospect, wasn't it inappropriate for someone like you in the middle of all this to have your son collecting money from this big credit card company while you were on the floor protecting its interests?\nSEN. BIDEN: Absolutely not. My son graduated from Yale Law School. The starting salary in Wall Street is $140,000 a year if you want to lawyer. Options he had. He came home to work for a bank. Surprise, surprise, number one. Number two, this is the second largest employer in the state. All the contributions added up make up less than 2 percent of the contributions I've received. Number three, I blocked the bank--first three bankruptcy bills that the credit card companies wanted. I would not support a bankruptcy bill until they did three things. They put women and children first. Every single social welfare agency relating to alimony and child support supported this bill. Eight-five senators supported this bill. So try as people might to make to this out.\nYou want to know whether or not I am in the pocket of the corporate lobbyists, which makes it apply--sounds like it's right here. Ask the people in the industry here how happy they are. How happy the DuPont company is with me and the Hercules Corporation that I would not sign on the asbestos bill. How happy they are with me--look, the fact of the matter is, that I have had an entire career that no one has every questioned whether or not anybody has influenced me, number one. No group has ever, ever been involved with more than--contributing more than 2 percent to my campaign. I'm listed as the 98th or 99th of the 100 poorest guy in the Senate in terms of net worth. I have a 35-year career of actually, of being viewed, at least in my state, as being independent. And so you can take individual votes and you can talk about them, but they're totally out of context, Tom.\nMR. BROKAW: But the fact is, it was not just the Republicans. It's your home town newspaper, consumers groups, a number of other people thought that you went way too far in bankruptcy protection and cracking down on those people who may not get the relief that they need.\nSEN. BIDEN: Well, and most people thought differently. But how come the social welfare agencies supported it, Tom? Are they a bunch of radical, corporate whatever? How come 89--or 85 United States senators supported it? Now, Barack voted a different way. I respect his vote. The question is, is the glass half-full or half-empty? Fewer than 10 percent of all the filers in bankruptcy are even affected. I'm the guy that insisted there be a safe harbor, that no one making under $50,000 or $49,000 could even be considered in this.\nAnd look, the big issue people have is what about people who go bankrupt because of their healthcare bills. That's why we need national health insurance. Are we going to say to every doctor and hospital, \"Look, you get to write off your bill, get to write off your bill because people can't pay.\" The way to do that, that's a societal responsibility, not the responsibility of individual doctors and--assuming they're charging a fair price. And so look, and everybody else voted--not everybody. The vast majority of the members of the Congress voted that way.\nMR. BROKAW: So if you get to Washington as president and vice president, given the promises that Senator Obama has made, would you look at situations like you just went through, which has raised some questions, where sons work for big banks that have interests in states...\nSEN. BIDEN: My son has never spoken. I voted for every campaign reform that's existed with regard to lobbyists. I voted for every single solitary proposal to make it tougher. And if you ask around here, ask--try to find how many lobbyists have actually--I probably have spoken to lobbyists, but I don't--it's not a practice I have. If they want to see me, the CEO has to come and see me from the company.\nMR. BROKAW: But specifically, what would this administration do about K Street and lobbyists, which has begun...\nSEN. BIDEN: Well, what, what they would do is they'd stop them from writing the bills. They wouldn't be sitting like Cheney was with lobbyists, writing an energy policy. They'd get to have their voice. Look, there is a thing called free speech. They get to petition their government. But in terms of their ability to be able to set the agenda, write legislation, be these--and my--you know, it's just, it would not--it just a total different atmosphere. A totally different atmosphere, just like it was 25 years ago when it didn't become such a growth industry.\nMR. BROKAW: You're a lifetime communicant in the Catholic Church. You've talked often about your faith and the, and the strength of your feelings about your faith.\nSEN. BIDEN: Actually, I haven't talked often about my faith. I seldom talk about my faith. Other people talk about my faith.\nMR. BROKAW: I'll give you an opportunity to talk about it now.\nSEN. BIDEN: Yeah.\nMR. BROKAW: Two weeks ago I interviewed Senator Nancy Pelosi--she's the speaker of the House, obviously--when she was in Denver. When Barack Obama appeared before Rick Warren, he was asked a simple question: When does life begin? And he said at that time that it was above his pay grade. That was the essence of his question. When I asked the speaker what advice she would give him about when life began, she said the church has struggled with this issue for a long time, especially in the last 50 years or so. Her archbishop and others across the country had a very strong refutation to her views on all this; I guess the strongest probably came from Edward Cardinal Egan, who's the Archbishop of New York. He said, \"Anyone who dares to defend that they may be legitimately killed because another human being `chooses' to do so or for any other equally ridiculous reason should not be providing leadership in a civilized democracy worthy of the name.\" Those are very strong words. If Senator Obama comes to you and says, \"When does life begin? Help me out here, Joe,\" as a Roman Catholic, what would you say to him?\nSEN. BIDEN: I'd say, \"Look, I know when it begins for me.\" It's a personal and private issue. For me, as a Roman Catholic, I'm prepared to accept the teachings of my church. But let me tell you. There are an awful lot of people of great confessional faiths--Protestants, Jews, Muslims and others--who have a different view. They believe in God as strongly as I do. They're intensely as religious as I am religious. They believe in their faith and they believe in human life, and they have differing views as to when life--I'm prepared as a matter of faith to accept that life begins at the moment of conception. But that is my judgment. For me to impose that judgment on everyone else who is equally and maybe even more devout than I am seems to me is inappropriate in a pluralistic society. And I know you get the push back, \"Well, what about fascism?\" Everybody, you know, you going to say fascism's all right? Fascism isn't a matter of faith. No decent religious person thinks fascism is a good idea.\nMR. BROKAW: But if you, you believe that life begins at conception, and you've also voted for abortion rights...\nSEN. BIDEN: No, what a voted against curtailing the right, criminalizing abortion. I voted against telling everyone else in the country that they have to accept my religiously based view that it's a moment of conception. There is a debate in our church, as Cardinal Egan would acknowledge, that's existed. Back in \"Summa Theologia,\" when Thomas Aquinas wrote \"Summa Theologia,\" he said there was no--it didn't occur until quickening, 40 days after conception. How am I going out and tell you, if you or anyone else that you must insist upon my view that is based on a matter of faith? And that's the reason I haven't. But then again, I also don't support a lot of other things. I don't support public, public funding. I don't, because that flips the burden. That's then telling me I have to accept a different view. This is a matter between a person's God, however they believe in God, their doctor and themselves in what is always a--and what we're going to be spending our time doing is making sure that we reduce considerably the amount of abortions that take place by providing the care, the assistance and the encouragement for people to be able to carry to term and to raise their children.\nMR. BROKAW: Finally, let me ask you about your old colleague, Joe Lieberman, who had a prime time speaking appearance last week at the Republican convention.\nSEN. BIDEN: He did, didn't he.\nMR. BROKAW: Let's just share with you what Senator Lieberman had to say about the top of your ticket...\nSEN. BIDEN: Yeah.\nMR. BROKAW: ...Senator Obama.\n(Videotape, Tuesday)\nSEN. JOE LIEBERMAN (I/D-CT): Senator Barack Obama is a gifted and eloquent young man who I think can do great things for our country in the years ahead, but my friends, eloquence is no substitute for a record, not in these tough times for America.\n(End videotape)\nSEN. BIDEN: Was he talking about...\nMR. BROKAW: And two...\nSEN. BIDEN: Was he talking about Palin or was he talking about....\nMR. BROKAW: Two paragraphs later he went on to say that Sarah Palin is qualified to be just a heartbeat away from the presidency. Harry Reid, the majority leader of the Senate, your leader, was very disappointed. His aide said Wednesday, Reid spokesman Jim Manly, said that Lieberman \"appeared to go out of his way to distort Senator Obama's record of bipartisan achievements in the Senate.\" Should Joe Lieberman be welcomed back in the Democratic caucus?\nSEN. BIDEN: Hey, look, we Catholics believe in redemption. I--look I...\nMR. BROKAW: You also--you also believe in trying to have a filibuster-proof Senate.\nSEN. BIDEN: Well, that's true. And look, Joe's been my friend for years. Our children are friends, his daughter-in-law was in my son's wedding, we go back a long way. Every time I see Joe these days, I walk up and I say, \"Say it ain't so, Joe. Say it ain't so.\" And look, Joe's made a judgment. Joe's going to have to make a tougher judgment when this election is over.\nMR. BROKAW: But at the same time, you and Senator Obama, John McCain and Sarah Palin are saying this is a change election. We're going to change the way business is done in Washington. And then the American people watch Joe Lieberman in what many of them would see as an act of betrayal against his own party. People say, \"Well, hey, he's my old buddy, he's welcome back.\"\nSEN. BIDEN: Well, look. I don't want to personalize this election. Like I said, I heard Sarah Palin and John McCain talk about change. Tell me one single thing they're going to do on the economy, foreign policy, taxes, that is going to be change. Name me one. This is such malarkey. Ninety percent of the time, John votes with the president. Same tax cut, he jumps on his tax cut proposal, which was disastrous, he jumps on his foreign policy, which has been a complete and utter failure. He jumps on the whole idea that he has about how to deal with healthcare, which is to tax. John wants to tax healthcare benefits for people who get their healthcare from their employers? Tell me where the change is. My goodness. He may change on how he deals with a lobbyist, but the idea on the economy, healthcare, education, same outfit, same deal, no change.\nMR. BROKAW: Senator Joe Biden of Wilmington, Delaware, vice presidential candidate of the Democratic Party, thanks very much for being with us.\nSEN. BIDEN: Thanks, Tom. Thanks for having me.\n",

    "text": "\nEight years ago, a man ran for President who claimed he was different, not a typical Republican. He called himself a reformer. He admitted that his Party, the Republican Party, had been wrong about things from time to time. He promised to work with Democrats and said he'd been doing that for a long time.\nThat candidate was George W. Bush. Remember that? Remember the promise to reach across the aisle? To change the tone? To restore honor and dignity to the White House?\nWe saw how that story ends. A record number of home foreclosures. Home values, tumbling. And the disturbing news that the crisis you've been facing on Main Street is now hitting Wall Street, taking down Lehman Brothers and threatening other financial institutions.\nWe've seen eight straight months of job losses. Nearly 46 million Americans without health insurance. Average incomes down, while the price of everything -- from gas to groceries -- has skyrocketed. A military stretched thin from two wars and multiple deployments.\nA nation more polarized than I've ever seen in my career. And a culture in Washington where the very few wealthy and powerful have a seat at the table and everybody else is on the menu.\nEight years later, we have another Republican nominee who's telling us the exact same thing:\nThis time it will be different, it really will. This time he's going to put country before party, to change the tone, reach across the aisle, change the Republican Party, change the way Washington works.\nWe've seen this movie before, folks. But as everyone knows, the sequel is always worse than the original.\nIf we forget this history, we're going to be doomed to repeat it -- with four more just like the last eight, or worse. If you're ready for four more years of George Bush, John McCain is your man.\nJust as George Herbert Walker Bush was nicknamed \"Bush 41\" and his son is known as \"Bush 43,\" John McCain could easily become known as \"Bush 44.\"\nThe campaign a person runs says everything about the way they'll govern. The McCain-Palin campaign has decided to bet the house on the politics perfected by Karl Rove. Those tactics may be good at squeaking by in an election, but they are bad if you want to lead one nation, indivisible.\nI count John McCain as a friend. I've known him since before he was a Senator. If he needed my personal help, I'd go. He served our country bravely, nobly. But America needs more than a great solider, America needs a wise leader.\nTake a hard look at the positions John has taken for the past 26 years, on the economy, on health care, on foreign policy, and you'll see why I say that John McCain is just four more years of George Bush. On the issues that you talk about around the kitchen table, Mary's college tuition, the cost of the MRI for mom, heating our home this winter -- John McCain is profoundly out of touch.\nSenator McCain has confessed, quote, \"It's easy for me to go to Washington and frankly, be somewhat divorced from the day-to-day challenges people have.\" And he's right, if all you do is walk the halls of power, all you hear are the wants of the powerful.\nI believe that's why Senator McCain could say with a straight face, as recently as this morning, and I quote \"the fundamentals of our economy are strong.\" That, \"We've made great progress economically\" during the Bush years. But friends, I could walk from here to Lansing, and I wouldn't run into a single person who thought our economy was doing well, unless I ran into John McCain.\nJohn McCain just doesn't seem to understand what middle class people are going through today. I don't doubt that he cares. He just doesn't think that we have any responsibility to help people who are hurting.\nMy dad used to have an expression: \"Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value.\"\nBy that measure, John McCain doesn't stand with the middle class. He stands with George Bush firmly in the corner of the wealthy and well-connected. He stands with the CEO of Exxon-Mobil, who, while testifying before my Senate judiciary committee swore to me under oath that Exxon-Mobil didn't need the tax breaks they'd been given to explore for oil.\nJohn McCain is so firmly in their corner he thinks the Exxon-Mobils of the world should get an additional $4 billion dollars a year in tax cuts.\nHe stands in the corner of the wealthiest Americans by extending tax cuts for people making over a quarter million dollars a year, and then adding more than $300 billion on top of that for corporations and the wealthy.\nThere is simply no daylight - at least none I can see -- between John McCain and George Bush.\nOn every major challenge we face, from the economy, to health care, to education and Iraq, you can barely tell them apart.\nDon't take my word for it, look at the record. Ninety percent of the time, John McCain votes with George Bush.\nHere's what that means:\nWhen George Bush called for Social Security to be privatized, John McCain stood with him - he even campaigned for that roundly rejected plan.\nWhen George Bush says that the government has no obligation to re-train or provide extended unemployment benefits for people who have lost their jobs due to trade agreements,\nJohn McCain echoes that view, and has said that Bush is \"Right on tradeâ€¦ absolutely.\"\nWhen George Bush said we shouldn't investigate why the government's response to Hurricane Katrina was so incompetent, John McCain stood with him.\nWhen George Bush initially opposed a new GI Bill that would send a new generation of veterans to college, John McCain stood with him, calling Senator Webb's effort too generous.\nWhen George Bush blocked our efforts to provide health care to another 3.8 million children, John McCain stood with him.\nAnd when, in early 2007, George Bush suggested that the health care benefits you get through your employer should be taxed as income, John McCain stood with him. And now, ladies and gentlemen, John McCain has resurrected that idea, and made it an essential part of his health care plan.\nIssue after issue, vote after vote, the story is the same.\nIn the last 16 years, he's voted 23 times against the renewable energy - wind, solar, biofuels -- we need to free ourselves from foreign oil.\nSince he arrived in the Senate over 20 years ago, he's voted more than 19 times against the minimum wage.\nIn 1994, I wrote and we passed a Crime bill that put 100,000 new police officers on the street, 3,300 of them here in Michigan, provided shelters and security for tens of thousands of battered women, and helped lead to an eight year drop in violent crime. John opposed the crime bill and the Violence Against Women Act it contained, calling them \"ineffective\" and \"ill conceived.\"\nTime and again John voted against increased funding for Pell grants to help families with incomes under $55,000 send their kids to college.\nTime and again, John McCain voted to make it harder for women to achieve equal pay for the same work - making it harder to prove, and punish, discrimination. He even voted against a study to determine if there is a gap between what men and women are paid. Twice.\nGovernor Palin says all senators do is vote. Well, just imagine what the country would look like if John's votes had become the law of the land.\nIn John McCain's America, we wouldn't guarantee that more of energy would come from wind, solar, and other renewables. The minimum wage would still be $3.35 an hour. There would have been 100,000 fewer police on the beat. There would have been no national domestic violence hotline for the 1.5 million women who were in crisis and needed somewhere to turn.\nOver 160,000 members of the Guard and Reserve who answered their country's call and served more than one tour in Iraq or Afghanistan would get no credit towards an education for their additional sacrifice. Fewer parents would be able to afford to send their kids to college. And women who were discriminated against on the basis of pay would more difficulty making their case. Thank God that's not the America we live in.\nJohn McCain recently said: \"the issue of economics is not something I've understood as well as I should.\" Then he proved it by the advisors he chose to surround him - advisors who have further cocooned him from the reality facing the rest of us. People like Phil Gramm. The man who wrote John McCain's economic plan actually said, repeatedly, that we're not going through an economic recession. Phil Gramm says it's just a mental recession. That we're a nation of whiners.\nTell that to my friend who flew jets for the Navy and then went to work for a commercial airline for over 20 years - only to see his pension wiped out while his CEO got a golden parachute. Don't tell me that he is a whiner.\nDon't tell me that the woman I met in Missouri who worked for the Chrysler plant for 13 years making minivans and lost her job when production moved to Canada is a whiner.\nDon't tell me that an engineer who sees his job go overseas because his company has been given a tax break to leave instead of one to stay is a whiner.\nDon't tell me that these people, people who are our nation's heart and soul - deserve to be treated as economic scapegoats.\nThese people worked hard, they did everything right, and they're willing to work hard again. But instead of their government supporting them, their government walked away from them. Nobody stood up for them.\nBarack and I will.\nWhat is John's response to the state of the economy? Let me quote him: \"A lot of this is psychological.\" Let me tell you something: Losing your job is more than a state of mind.\nIt means staring at the ceiling at night thinking that you may lose your house because you can't get next month's mortgage payment. It means looking at your pregnant wife and not knowing how you're going to come up with the money to pay for the delivery of your child, since you don't have health care anymore. It means looking at your child when they come home from college at Christmas and saying \"Honey, I'm sorry, we're not going to be able to send you back next semester.\" It's not a state of mind. It's a loss of dignity.\nWhen you and your economic advisors are so out of touch, it's no surprise that your economic policies ignore the challenges that normal families face.\nLet me just give you one more example. In the midst of this housing crisis, John McCain said, \"I will fight for those that lost theirâ€¦ real estate investments.\" He went on to say, \"It's not the role of government to bail out big banks or small borrowers.\" What about small borrowers? What about homeowners? What about the people who don't invest in homes, but live in them? There's an important distinction between the predators and the preyed upon.\nI heard that a Republican County Chairman right here in Michigan said that they're keeping a list of foreclosed homes, suggesting that if you've lost your home, you should also lose your vote. I have a different idea. I think that if you're worried about losing your home, you should vote for the guys who are going to help you keep it!\nWhatever happened to the guy, who once denounced tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans in a time of war as immoral.\nWhen someone running for election changes his views to satisfy the base of the party, that's not change, that's just more of the same Washington game. The problem is that in the Washington game today, the American people are losing.\nLadies and Gentlemen, as of today, there are 50 days until Election Day. That's just seven more weeks to talk about the direction we're going to take this country, to talk about the issues of concern in your lives, to talk about you. But as his campaign manager has said, and I quote, \"This election is not about issues.\"\nWhen Senator McCain was subjected to unconscionable, scurrilous attacks in his 2000 primary campaign, I called him on the phone to ask what I could do. And now, some of the very same people and the tactics he once deplored his campaign now employs. The same campaign that once called for a town hall a week is now launching a low blow a day.\nBarack and I can take it. That's not what bothers me.\nIt bothers me that -- as one media watchdog put it -- John's recent commercial is the, \"latest in a number that resort to a dubious disregard for the facts.\" As another news organization put it: The wheels have come off the straight talk express.\nBut what really bothers me, is that every punch thrown at us --- is an attempt to distract you. And they can be plenty distracting.\nLike the McCain advertisements that misrepresent a vote by Barack Obama to protect young children from sexual predators. Like Senator McCain's effort to obscure the fact that Barack Obama's tax cuts will benefit 95 percent of all working people. Like John McCain's attempt to cloak himself in reform by misrepresenting his running mate's record.\nIt's disappointing to me to think that John McCain really does approve this message.\nEvery false debate we're drawn into is a real conversation we don't have with the American people. Character attacks get media attention, but they make this election about us when it really needs to be about you.\nBarack Obama believes that progress in this country is measured by how many people have a decent job where they're shown respect. How many people can pay their mortgage. How many people can turn their ideas into a new business. How many people can turn to their kids and say \"It's going to be okay\" with the knowledge that the opportunities they give will be better than the ones they received.\nThat's the American dream. That's what the people in my neighborhood grew up believing. And I want our kids to have the same dream.\nBarack Obama starts from that vision of progress and will do what it takes to get us there.\nThat's why his tax cuts - benefit the middle class. That's why he'll make it easier for families to afford college for their kids. That's why he says everyone should be able to have the same health care that members of Congress have. That's why his energy plan will reduce our dependence on foreign oil, bring down gas prices, and, in the process, we'll create five million new green jobs. Those are the changes we need.\nYes, this campaign is about change, but it's about even more than that. It's about what we value as a people. It's not just about a job, it's about dignity. It's not just about a paycheck. It's about pride. It's not just about opportunity. It's about respect. That's why Barack and I are in this race.\nWe know we need change if we're to restore dignity, pride, and respect. We know America's best days are ahead of us, and we know why we're here.\nWe're here for the for the cops and firefighters, the teachers and assembly line workers, the engineers and office workers, the small business owners and the retiree.\nAll of the folks who play by the rules, work hard, and do what is asked of them. They deserve a government as good and an economy as strong as they are.\nWe're all are Americans. There has never been a challenge too great. The stakes have never been higher.\nMy father always told me, \"Champ, when you get knocked down, get up. Get up.\" It's time to get up. It's time to trust the grit and determination of the American people.\nAmerica is ready. You are ready. I am ready. And Barack Obama is ready. Our best days are yet to come.\nMay god bless America and may God protect our troops.\n",

    "text": "\nROBERTS: So, what would Barack Obama and Joe Biden do to jump start the economy? Joining me now from Washington, is the Democratic vice presidential candidate Senator Joe Biden.\nSenator, it's good to see you.\nBIDEN: Hi, John.\nROBERTS: Let me ask you this question. When everything is going on in Wall Street and the economy now, DOW down 500 points below 11,000.\nIf you were in the administration right now, what would you be doing?\nBIDEN: Create jobs, keep people in their homes and increase regulatory oversight of the very people John has refused to regulate. And by creating job, we'd spend $600 billion on going out -- $60 billion creating new infrastructure jobs, roads, highways, bridges, all the things we need. Keep people in their houses by allowing them to renegotiate not only their interest on their loans, but their principle on their loans and bankruptcy. Make sure that we're in a position where we start to deal with the debt.\nLook, John talked -- I just heard John's interview, I find it absolutely fascinating. This is the same guy who wants to continue to spend $10 billion a months on the war in Iraq, when the Iraqis have $80 billion stashed away from oil prices. It's the same fellow who's going to part of his administration view he shares, it's going to hand the next president a $400 billion debt deficit for that year. This is the same guy who watched and presided over, not presided over, but supported Bush, says the economy's strong. And we lost 604,000 jobs this year.\nCome on! And the truth of the matter is, is what you heard in the last interview. Every economist points out that we give out tax breaks to the middle class. We're not raining total taxes. What we're doing is letting taxes expire for the very wealthy and giving the middle class a fighting chance --\nROBERTS: But, Senator, at the same time though, as you said, you are raising some taxes. You'll be raising income tax on people who make more than $250,000. You would likely also raise the FICA withholding on high interest --\nBIDEN: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not true. We would not raise the FICA withholding. We would reduce the FICA withholding.\nAnd look, every study shows -- 95 percent of the people are going to get a tax --\nROBERTS: Are you not thinking about raising the income cap in FICA withholding?\nBIDEN: Yes. But, that's for people over $250,000.\nROBERTS: Right. Sorry, that's what I said.\nBIDEN: Let's get it straight though, John. We're talking about people over $250,000, who are doing very well, thank you.\nROBERTS: That was my point. You're thinking of raising taxes on people who make more than $250,000.\nBIDEN: That's right.\nROBERTS: FICA withholding and income tax. With the economy the way it is right now, is this anytime to be raising taxes on anyone?\nBIDEN: We are transferring the tax cut. We're raising the tax on them by letting this tax expire and flipping that tax and giving it to the people who need it. So, the total tax cut --\nROBERTS: Some people would say that's income redistribution.\nBIDEN: Well, I don't care what you call it, the middle class is dying. John talks about the strength of the American worker. The American worker's been left out in cold. Look what's happened.\nWe accumulated a trillion dollar debt to foreign governments. We're paying the highest prices we've ever paid for oil because we have no energy policy. We have the highest unemployment rate in five years. We're in a situation where middle class people are struggling, they're hanging on. And what are they doing for them? Zero. It's been this profligate spending on the rich and Wall Street. No oversight of any consequence. And when you ask John the question a moment ago, when he was asked the question, what new regulation would you put on, he said, we'll we had a modern regulation for the modern economy. Hey, bottom line is, if you come to the federal government, to the fed to borrow money, we get to look at your books. It's my money, it's the tax payers money. We get to look at your books, John. We get to have total oversight. You want to borrow the money, you let us see the inside of your books. Up until now, John has totally opposed that. This administration has.\nAnd I ask the rhetorical question, who's the captain (INAUDIBLE) the helm, for the last eight years has driven us into this God awful economic mess at home and abroad? It's been the Republicans. The Republican economic philosophy that John is adhered to that's driven us into this whole. And when you have a doctor who's performed malpractice on you and he's been convicted of it, you usually don't hire him to do the second operation.\nROBERTS: Senator, yesterday a couple of times, you dinged Senator McCain pretty hard for saying that the fundamentals of the economy were sound. At about the same time, Mayor Michael Bloomberg from New York, was talking with politico, and he also suggested that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.\nIs he wrong, as well?\nBIDEN: Well, let me -- absolutely. Let me tell you. Look, here's how we look at this stuff. I look at this stuff from the neighborhood up. Take a look at what middle class people are going through. Tell me how it's sound that we have the highest foreclosure rate since the Great Depression.\nTell me how it's sound that you have 84,000 people lose their jobs last year. Tell me how it's sound that in fact, people can't get their kids to college. Their health care costs have gone up 87 percent. Tell me how it's sound that middle class people have lost $2,000 in income on an annualized base during this administration. Tell me how it's sounds that you have one percent of the people in the United States of America, making 23,4 percent of all the income in America. That hasn't happened since 1921. It's sound if you're very wealthy. It's a disaster if you're a hard working middle class family who goes from paycheck to paycheck and worry about paying your mortgage.\nROBERTS: Let me turn to the issue of earmarks, if I could. Because we asked Senator McCain about that. He has made that a centerpiece of his campaign. You have been in the Senate for 36 years. You have only ever disclosed one year of your earmarks, that's $342 million for fiscal year '09.\nWhy did you not disclose the other years?\nBIDEN: Because it was all open in my state. I've disclosed all the time. The earmarks of the state of Delaware has gotten every single time, everyone has seen them. And we have no wall there. We have no Lawrence Wealth museums. We have no Bridges to Nowhere in Delaware. It's all straight up. And by, let's put this in perspective. I love John. He says he's going to balance this budget by earmarks. If you eliminate every single earmark in the entire United States government, that's $18 billion a year. John, what are you going to do with the $400 billion in debt, John? John, what are you going to do with the trillion dollar additional tax cut you want to give to the wealthy?\nCome on, this is time for a little truth and lending here.\nROBERTS: I've got to get to one political question here.\nBIDEN: Sure.\nROBERTS: Polls in Minnesota that came out yesterday show an even up there. It's the most reliably Democratic state in the nation. There's a poll out that shows New York now within five points. John McCain is starting to peel off white women. He's also starting to attract some Independents.\nSenator, what's going on?\nBIDEN: What's going on is, his campaign is over. I mean, the convention is over. They got a big hit. And as every Independent news organization points out --\nROBERTS: Yes, but you didn't get a similar hit in Colorado.\nBIDEN: Well, we did. We went up eight points.\nROBERTS: Not now.\nBIDEN: Then it got wiped -- no, I got that, John. We went up -- look, we're right back where we were essentially before. And part of the reason --\nROBERTS: But, not in Minnesota.\nBIDEN: But we are in other states. We're up I think 12 points in Iowa, for example. Another toss up state we didn't win last time. So, you want to go state by state, the bottom line is this. Look, what every Independent news agency has pointed out the ads that the McCain campaign is running since they hired the very people that went after them in 2000, in the Bush time, what happened? Where they're misrepresenting Barack Obama's record, they're misrepresenting -- for example, John had the audacity to say, when confronted with a question, isn't it true, as the economists say, that 95 percent of the people are going to get their taxes cut?\nWhat was his answer? There's a nice, honest answer. Well, that's true under Barack Obama, that's true. But, we like our plan better. Instead, they're saying, Barack Obama is going to raise taxes on middle income people. They're saying Barack Obama supported sex education for kindergardeners, when all he said was, we should teach our kids how to avoid predators. It's very misleading and it's about -- and the public, I have confidence in them that they're going to see through this fog and remember how's been at the helm when this ship has stayed, has run aground. And it's been the philosophy of the Republican Party that John is a disciple of.\nROBERTS: Senator Biden, it's always great to talk to you. Thanks for coming on this morning.\nBIDEN: Good to be with you John.\n",

    "text": "\nThank you, General Umbarger. It's also good to see my friends General Frank Vavala, and General Hugh Broomall.\nI come here today with a profound respect for the Guard.\nI'm here as a citizen, who knows that our nation depends on the service of those who are civilians in peace, soldiers in war - not only to defend us abroad, but aid us when disaster strikes here at home.\nI'm here as a Senator, who has traveled to conflict zones all around the world - Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq -- and disaster areas across America and seen the heroic work our young men and women in arms do to protect our citizens, protect our interests and to demonstrate not only the example of our force... but also the force of our example.\nI'm here today as the father of a Guardsman. My son Beau is proud to wear the uniform, and proud to answer the call to serve.\nAnd I'm here as the Democratic candidate for Vice President, knowing that you have served with great distinction time and again.\nYou have never let us down... but too often, your government has not given you all you've needed.\nIssues affecting the Guard sit at the core of our two great national challenges - national security and economic security. Barack and I know that we need to strengthen both. That means supporting your missions at home and abroad, and making sure you return to strong secure jobs and a sound economy.\nYesterday, you heard John McCain claim that behind the positions Barack Obama takes \"lies the ambition to be president.\"\nLet me just say this: after the last eight years, the last thing we need is more of the politics of division.\nNo one party has a monopoly on virtue or good ideas.\nWe can question each other's judgments. That's what elections are all about.\nBut we have to stop questioning each other's motives and each other's patriotism.\nWhether we're Democrats, Republicans or Independents, we all share a profound desire to do right by America.\nWe all put country first.\nWhen John and I send our sons to war, they don't wear a Republican flag or a Democratic flag. They wear an American flag.\nOur only differences are on how best to protect our national interests, and serve our military.\nAnd we do have differences.\nLet's begin where we are right now, right this minute.\nWe depend on you as never before.\nMore than half - 52% -- of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom veterans are Guard or Reserve.\nThat has never happened before.\nYou have new and increased responsibility, but in my view - we haven't given you the command and equipment in support of those new responsibilities.\nBut you never complain. You always step up.\nIt's time for a change.\nChange begins with giving the Guard a seat at the table. That table in the Pentagon where the Joint Chiefs sit.\nGeneral McKinley, I not only want to see your fourth star - I want to see you sitting there with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen.\nYour men and women are serving and dying. Your voice needs to be heard.\nWhen it comes to equipment -- to train on, to deploy with, and to have available at home for war or natural disasters - we have not provided what you need.\nAnd that's wrong.\nNinety percent of units have serious equipment shortages.\nCollectively, over $100 billion worth of equipment has been left in Iraq.\nAnd we've seen the consequences of that.\nSimply put, the states have been left with the tab to make up for this equipment shortage.\nSince September 11th, 2001, more than half a million reservists have been mobilized and deployed for homeland security missions and combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nEvery National Guard combat brigade has deployed at least once. Specialty units like military police, special forces, and medical units have deployed multiple times.\nIn Iraq and Afghanistan 870 members of the guard and reserve have given their lives.\n6,785 have been wounded.\nOf all serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, we have some 900 returning amputees, many of them Guardsmen.\nAnd many who come home bear less visible - but nonetheless deep -- scars.\nRoughly 320,000 -- nearly 20% -- may have experienced traumatic brain injury.\nAbout 300,000 - nearly 19% -- meet the criteria for either PTSD or depression.\nIn 2006, the most recently recorded year, we saw 113 Iraq and Afghanistan-era veterans lost to the enemy of suicide.\nThat's a record number, and more than twice the suicide rate for civilians of the same age.\nAnd multiple deployments have added to the financial and marital tension for many of your Guardsmen.\nReports show 11,000 guardsmen and women lost their jobs upon returning home - a clear violation of the law. That must stop.\nBarack and I are going to set this straight.\nAnd we have very different ideas on how do it than John McCain and Sarah Palin.\nIt starts with a guarantee that every returning veteran has the best health care available. We're been fighting for this as Senators, and we'll guarantee it as President and Vice President.\nShift the burden to the government: no more requiring a soldier to prove that their traumatic brain injuries are combat related.\nSpend the money and hire the personnel to eliminate waiting time for the VA to decide on a disability claim.\nGuarantee that any returning veteran needing a prosthesis will have the most up-to-date, state-of-the-art, for the his or her life.\nAnd zero tolerance for veteran homelessness.\nYou know Barack is on the Veterans Affairs committee in the Senate. I watched him work with Republicans to pass a major law - with short term fixes and long term solutions - to end the shameful care we were giving our veterans at Walter Reed.\nHe strengthened programs to help homeless veterans... he fought for fair treatment of veterans' claims and forced the VA to fix disparities... he helped ensure that all service members returning from Iraq are properly screened for Traumatic Brain Injuries... and he demanded a major national research effort into the readjustment needs of returning veterans.\nHe will see to it that all veterans - all veterans - have access to the VA system.\nMilitary families need help coping with deployments.\nWe'll expand, Family Medical Leave to include reserve families facing mobilization.\nWe'll add resources to help military families during deployments, such as more staff for Family Readiness Groups.\nBecause when soldiers go to war, their families go too.\nJohn McCain says we're a nation at war.\nHe's wrong, we're a military at war.\nThe only ones making the real sacrifice are those deployed, and their families back home.\nSecond, we're going to restore your readiness.\nThat starts with increasing the end strength of the active military.\nWe're going to increase our end strength by 65,000 for the Army, and 27,000 for the Marines.\nIncreasing the size of the active force means they can carry a heavier burden, allowing our Guard to have fewer deployments and more predictable deployments, with more time between them.\nTo cut down on equipment shortages, Barack Obama and I will end the trend of cannibalizing soldiers and machines from units back home for missions abroad.\nWe'll consult with governors of the 50 states, so we know what the needs of their Guard units are - both for their combat missions overseas, and their domestic missions at home.\nRemember in 2006, when it was reported that the Department of Defense was making plans to cut National Guard force structure and strength?\nBarack Obama and I were two of the 75 Senators to send a letter to the Secretary of Defense strongly opposing those plans.\nJohn McCain didn't sign.\nWe believe we shouldn't be cutting back on the Guard at the very time we're asking you to do more.\nThird, we're going to make sure that you have opportunity when you come home.\nWe'll start by putting the federal government on your side.\nThe Department of Defense, Department of Labor, Department of Justice - they have an obligation, each of them, to guarantee that laws designed to protect returning veterans are enforced.\nA recent survey found that 44% of employers would not hire a reservist - even though that's illegal discrimination - for fear that that employee might be called up.\nThe Department of Defense currently has no plan to ensure that businesses comply with re-employment laws for our Guard and Reserves. And the Labor Department and Justice Department have failed to vigorously enforce the laws which protect you, the men and women who have volunteered to protect us.\nSeventy percent of Guardsmen work for small businesses, and DOD has no outreach program to small business.\nYou shouldn't have to sacrifice your job in order to serve your country.\nBut your country owes you more than putting you back in the place you were before you left.\nIt owes you greater opportunity, because of lost opportunity.\nAnd it all starts with education.\nThat is why Barack and I were supporters from the start of Jim Webb's GI Bill - which allows National Guard and Reserve members to earn educational benefits based on their total cumulative active duty... instead of their single longest tour, the way they do in existing Title 10 programs.\nBecause we think that a Guardsman who serves three tours of 6 months should be credited for a year and a half of service, and not half a year.\n \nJohn McCain is a friend, a patriot, and a hero.\nBut John and I have some fundamental disagreements as it relates to the Guard, and the interests of veterans.\nJohn McCain voted against billions of dollars in additional funding for veterans' health care - against $2 million for TBI research... against $500 million for mental health issues... against $400 million for inpatient and outpatient care.\nJohn wants to ration veterans' health care to those with combat injuries, which would mean that millions fewer veterans would have access to VA medical care.\nAnd while Barack and I supported Senator Jim Webb's bipartisan bill to update the GI Bill from the get-go, John initially opposed it because he thought it was too generous.\nJohn's version treated the Guard as second class citizens when it came to educational benefits.\nThose are the facts. But don't take it from me. Ask Disabled American Veterans, which represents millions of vets. They keep track of these things... John voted with DAV 20 percent of the time.\nBarack Obama - 80 percent of the time.\nOr ask the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. They keep track, too. They give letter grades, and they gave John McCain a \"D\". Barack got at B+.\nSo as much as I admire John, I disagree with him.\nBeing a veteran isn't the same as being there for veterans.\n \nWe need more than a great soldier, we need a wise leader.\nYesterday, John talked to you about the judgment required to be Commander in Chief.\nHe's right: nothing is more important than judgment.\nAnd time and again, on the most critical national security issues of our time. John McCain's judgment was wrong, and Barack Obama's was right.\nRight after 9-11, John was wrong to look beyond Afghanistan to war with Iraq, Iran, and North Korea.\nBarack was right that we should finish the war in Afghanistan -- and that Iraq was a huge diversion from defeating the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9-11.\nIn the run up to the Iraq war, like the Bush administration, John insisted that Saddam was in league with Al Qaeda and complicit in 9-11...\n... that we would be greeted as liberators...\n...that we didn't need a lot of troops...\n...that victory was imminent...\n....that Sunnis and Shiites would get along because \"there's not a history of clashes that are violent between\" them.\nHe lauded the administration's conduct of the war, singling out for praise Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Vice President Cheney.\nOn all of those counts, John's judgment was wrong.\nThen, John said there's nothing to talk about with Iran.\nBarack said hard headed diplomacy is the best way to focus Iran on what it stands to gain if its stops it nuclear program -- and what it will lose if it does not.\nNow, even the Bush administration sent our most senior diplomat for direct talks with Tehran. John wrong, Barack was right.\nJust three years ago, John said we were succeeding in Afghanistan.\nMore than a year ago, Barack said we were not -- and we needed at least two more combat brigades.\nNow, the Chairman of Joint Chiefs says we are not winning -- and we need more troops. John was wrong, Barack was right.\nJohn rejects a timeline for redeploying our combat forces from Iraq.\nBarack says shift the responsibility to the Iraqis and set a timeline to bring our combat forces home.\nNow, President Bush and the Maliki government are negotiating an agreement to do just that. John was wrong, Barack was right.\nMaybe most fundamentally of all, John McCain continues to insist, against all the evidence and all the facts, that Iraq is the central front in the war on terrorism.\nBarack Obama says that central front is where it has always been since 9-11 - the mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nOn this, John is more than wrong -- he is dangerously wrong -- and Barack Obama is right.\nOn a question so basic, so fundamental, so critical to our nation's security, we can't afford a Commander-in Chief so divorced from reality and from America's most basic national interests.\nAnd on the most important question for returning members of the guard - the strength of our economy - Barack has it right.\nBarack has the plans - which he's introducing today - to stabilize the US and world economic markets.\nIn the short term, it will keep this financial crisis from getting worse. It will help keep people in their homes, and protect their life savings.\nIn the long term, it will provide the protections necessary to make sure this never happens again.\nWe'll create millions of new jobs with investments in infrastructure and new energy technology - many of the same fields in which our guardsmen and reservists have developed skills.\nAnd, by the way, when we produce more of our energy at home, we'll be less reliant on protecting unstable supplies from unfriendly regimes.\nWe'll make sure that your bravery abroad is matched with opportunity upon your return, by investing in programs like the new GI Bill.\nI want to close by sharing something I experienced several weeks ago in Florida.\nA retired Marine stood up at an event where I was speaking.\nHe looked like he had something to get off his chest as he took the microphone from me. \"Senator,\" he said. \"I'd be proud to salute Barack Obama as my Commander-in-Chief.\"\nHe also told me that he'd be proud to salute me as his Vice President. I told him that nobody salutes the vice president.\nFolks, I couldn't say it better myself. I will be proud to salute Barack Obama as my Commander-in-Chief. And I think you will be, too.\nThank you.\n",

    "text": "\nBLITZER: The Democratic Vice-Presidential Nominee Joe Biden is standing by, he's joining us live, I suspect. He's got a different assessment of what just happened than Nicole Wallace.\nYou're smiling. But what do you say, Senator Biden to this charge that Senator McCain leveled against Senator Obama repeatedly that he simply doesn't understand what's going on, he doesn't have the experience to deal with what's going on and he's afraid to admit that he was wrong about the surge in Iraq?\nBIDEN: Hey, look, who was right and who was wrong? John McCain was dead wrong on the war, John McCain's been dead wrong in Afghanistan, John McCain's been dead wrong in his judgment supporting Bush's shredding national regulations to control Wall Street. And now John McCain says, talk about I heard the young woman, the lady behind me say that, you know, this was all about mainstream.\nWell, the mainstream wants to end the war in Iraq, let the Iraqis spend their $79 billion, not just have John continue to spend $10 billion a month.\nAnd so Wolf, on every single area, it seemed to me that John was mired in the past as he usually is. I'll give you one example, John tried to lecture Barack that the surge was a strategic idea. John, listen to me, our own commander said it was a tactic in order to reach a strategic objective. The strategic objective was increase force to give breathing room for the strategic political settlement.\nJohn doesn't even know the difference between strategy and tactic and he's trying to lecture Barack. He's been dead wrong on these issues; he's tethered to a failed policy that got us in this position.\nAnd think about it. The surge is over. What's John's answer, what does he do next? How do we leave Iraq and leave it stable? Barack has laid out exactly how to do that.\nAnd last point is John talks about how to protect America. He hasn't voted for the 9/11 commission recommendations, John hasn't voter for the veterans. The DAV rates him at 20 percent, disabled veterans of America.\nSo look, this was a -- I think John was on his strongest turf today and he lost and I think it's going to be fatal.\nBLITZER: Next Thursday, Senator Biden, I'm sure you're aware you will have your own debate against Sarah Palin --\nBIDEN: I will.\nBLITZER: At Washington University in St. Louis. What did you learn tonight about this first debate that might help you going forward?\nBIDEN: Well, I hope I can be as good as Barack Obama was and I hope that Sarah Palin defends the same position John McCain does. That's what I learned.\nNow, we may see a different thing. I have great respect for the -- what I hear and watched some of the debating skills of Governor Palin. I think it's going to be a really tough debate.\nBut I think this is all about where we are. Are we talking about past or the future, and what are you going to do? What's the future? What are you going to do economically and politically and what are you going to do relative to the war. And that's what I'm going to try to talk about and we'll see and let the voters make the judgment. I just hope I do as well as Barack did.\nBLITZER: We'll of course be here Thursday watching that 90-minute debate. One final question, Senator Biden, before I let you go I know we have only a limited window.\nWhat do you say to what Nicole Wallace and other McCain supporters say that John McCain came up with a bold decisive piece of action; he's going to have a spending freeze with the exception of national security or veterans or some of the entitlements if in fact he is elected president.\nHe says that Barack Obama really didn't come up with anything bold or decisive that given the enormity of this economic crisis we're facing right now.\nBIDEN: I didn't hear him when he said he'd consider that. What I heard was nobody knows what's going to happen in terms of this bailout. No one knows how much it's going to cut into, if it cuts into the ability of the next president to be able to move his programs.\nWhat I did hear Barack Obama say, was in order to get the economy moving again, we've got to deal with reinstating the middle class so they can have money to spend.\nI watched John McCain talk about how he's going to give $300 billion more to corporate America as well as the very wealthy. And Barack Obama says, look, give it to the people who need it, the people who in fact are in the middle class, that's going to move the economy.\nI didn't hear anything about the future from John. All I heard from John tonight was the past and quite frankly, his judgments in the past being tethered to the policies of Bush economically and in foreign policy I think had been an abject failure. As the old Ronald Reagan said, if you like the last eight years, then John McCain showed you, you should stick with him.\nBLITZER: Yes, you're right about that freeze, he said he would consider a freeze, he didn't say he would in fact go forward with a freeze.\nA little bit of preview of what we might be hearing from you next Thursday night. Senator Joe Biden thanks very much for joining us.\nBIDEN: Thanks an awful lot Wolf. Thanks for having me.\nBLITZER: All right Senator Joe Biden the Senator from Delaware, the Democratic Vice-Presidential Nominee.\n",

    "text": "\nHello, Charleston! Hello, West Virginia! It is so good to be here. In the last debate, John McCain felt the need to declare that he's not President Bush. And just yesterday, John McCain actually went so far as to try to compare Barack Obama to George W. Bush. As my granddaughter says: Hello? John McCain is now attacking the Bush budget and fiscal policies. Folks, this is as crazy as the Sundance Kid attacking Butch Cassidy! They were in this together.\nJohn McCain voted with George Bush 90 percent of the time. Until recently, he was bragging about it. He said these policies produced \"great economic progress.\" Look, I know Halloween is coming. But John McCain as the candidate of change? That's one costume the American people aren't going to buy. So I know we're not running against President Bush. But we are running against the very Bush economic policies John McCain is promising to continue. John McCain and Sarah Palin call themselves mavericks... but to paraphrase your neighbor -- Senator Bob Casey from Pennsylvania -- you can't call yourself a maverick when all you've been is a sidekick.\nIf you give Barack Obama and me the honor of serving as your President and Vice President, here is what we will do: We will commit ourselves - night and day - to two overriding goals. First, restore the middle class. Second, reclaim America's respect in the world. And the first step in reclaiming that leadership is to end this war in Iraq. We will end this war in Iraq -- responsibly. Now, even President Bush is getting behind Barack's plan to set a timeline for the withdrawal of our combat forces from Iraq. Only John McCain says no. He's wrong. And Barack Obama is right.\nTo rebuild the middle class, we need to cut taxes for working people. We need an energy policy that frees us from the grip of foreign oil, with a firm commitment and a long-term investment in alternative energy - wind, solar, biofuels, and clean coal. And let me say on that subject: John McCain doesn't believe clean coal is part of our energy future. Don't take my word for it - take his. He said \"...in a perfect world, we would like to transition away from coal entirely.\" And now, he plans on giving the oil companies - who are recording the largest profits in the history of the United States another $4 billion in tax cuts. So make no mistake: the oil companies have placed their bet on Senator McCain. That's why Appalachia can't afford to.\nBarack and I believe clean coal is part of our energy future. That's why we supported adding $200 million in funding for carbon capture and sequestration technology. Instead of pouring our energy dollars into the sands of Saudi Arabia and the pockets of Venezuela, we should be exporting home-made technology - solving not only our own energy challenges, but the worlds. We need to make an investment in rebuilding America's infrastructure - including broadband and the infrastructure of the future. Our plan that we estimate will create 12,000 jobs here in West Virginia alone. This is about jobs. But in a sense, it's about even more than jobs. It's about dignity. It's about respect. It's about understanding what people are going through. When a job is lost or a house is foreclosed on, it's not just an economic loss... it's emotionally devastation. It's about having to make that long walk up that short flight of stairs...That's something I've experienced. At the end of the day, if we want to strengthen the middle class and regain our respect in the world, we have to do one thing more: We have to unite this country.\nRecently, in North Carolina, Governor Palin said she was happy to be in a \"pro-America\" part of our country. I was just in North Carolina...and it is a deeply patriotic place. But every state has sent its sons and daughters to serve and die for this country. West Virginia is home to over 200,000 veterans. Nearly 1,500 West Virginians are currently deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. And 33 of these fallen angels have given their lives. We all love this country. We are all patriots. That's why we have to end the scurrilous phone calls -- which lie about Barack Obama and question his character. We're joined today by Chaylee Cole. Chaylee is a student at Fairmont State University who worked at a call center - where she was asked to make some of those attack calls.\nShe said no, and she was fired. But I want to read part of what Chaylee said when she was interviewed, \"Democrat or Republican, I wouldn't have done this.\" Chaylee recognized that regardless of your personal politics, attacks like that don't hurt Barack. They're an attempt to further divide the country, and distract you from the things that really matter. Barack can take two eleven more days of these attacks. Our country can't take four more years of Bush-McCain economic policies.\nWhat we need is the type of leadership being provided by your Governor, Joe Manchin. We need the type of leadership provided by your Senator, and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Jay Rockefeller. There is nobody both as knowledgeable and as straightforward.\nIt's time we're all reminded that we are: One nation -- under God. We are, indivisible.\nGreat leaders have always reminded us of this. And in West Virginia, you have one of the greatest. Senator Robert C. Byrd. Senator Byrd is a man who came up the hard way. He literally married a coal miner's daughter. He is the American dream. And he is a true friend. To learn about the ways of the Senate from Robert C. Byrd is like getting trumpet lessons from the Angel Gabriel.\nGreat presidents have always turned dire circumstances into real opportunities...by reminding Americans of what we've overcome in the past, and appealing to our better angels. And I believe Barack Obama will be a great president. My father always told me \"Champ, when you get knocked down, get up. Get up.\"\nI've never seen a time when more Americans have been knocked down. It's time for us to get up, together, and bring the change we need...to the country we love. America is ready. You are ready. I am ready. And Barack Obama is ready. It is our time. It is America's time. So let's get up. God bless America. And may God protect our troops.\n",

    "text": "\nThank you, Governor Rendell and Governor Douglas.\nAnd Governor Palin, your being here today sends a powerful message that when campaigns end, we are all partners in progress. Thank you.\nI always love events where seating is done by when your state entered the union. That's when it's good to be a Delawarean, and it's good to see Governor-elect Jack Markell here.\nOver the course of the campaign, I had the opportunity to travel through many of your states.\nOften, I'd be on a bus, and one of you -- or a local official -- would point out local landmarks.\nAnd the commentary was almost always, \"This used to be.\"\nThis \"used to be\" a steel mill. This town \"used to be\" the ceramics capital of America.\nThis factory \"used to\" employ 1,200 people. A company \"used to have\" their headquarters here.\nWe'll know we've turned the corner when we hear a lot less \"This used to be...\" and a lot more \"this is going to be.\"\nIn order to get to \"This is going to be\" we need to build a partnership with you -- that is much more robust and much deeper.\nAnd in doing that, the partnership we're able to build with all of you is crucial.\nEric Sevareid once told President Kennedy that: \"It doesn't make much sense when two people are sitting in a boat for one of them to point a finger accusingly at the other and say `your end of the boat is sinking.'\"\nOur nation can't succeed unless our states succeed.\nBarack and I recognize this.\nAnd we recognize that you've all been incredibly hard hit by this economic crisis.\nAlready 41 states are looking at budget shortfalls this year or next.\nThat is why help for you -- everything from direct aid, to countercyclical investments, to benefit programs, to infrastructure investment -- will be key parts of our economic plan.\nOn infrastructure specifically, we have a huge opportunity. China invests 7-9 percent of its GDP in infrastructure projects. We invest just 1 percent. There's a reason they have a mag-lev train that can go over 200 miles per hour.\nI may have a bit of a pro-rail bias, but think of the jobs we could create -- in both construction and innovation -- if we made similarly bold investments here.\nWe should fast-track funding for the thousands of ready-to-go projects across the country that can quickly put people back to work and lay the foundation for long-term growth.\nIn the longer term, we are calling for the creation of a new National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank that will help us make the investments we need to build a 21st century transportation system -- while creating jobs and taking the politics out of infrastructure spending. And it has the added benefit of making American business more competitive in the world.\nWe believe that, together, we can make this country again, in the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson, a place \"of beginnings, of projects, of vast designs and expectations.\"\nDespite all of our challenges, I'm struck by how hopeful our nation remains...\n... People understand the serious challenges we face -- but they also believe that with leadership in Washington and in your states that gives people the chance to succeed -- there's nothing we can't do.\nWe should view this moment of challenge as a moment of great opportunity ---\nPerhaps most importantly, Barack understands that change is a means, and not an end. And together, we can change \"this used to be\" into \"this is going to be.\"\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce a man who has inspired this nation, and who I am honored to join as a partner in leading this nation.\nPlease join me in welcoming President-elect Barack Obama.\n",

    "text": "\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Howard, thank you very much and my colleagues, Ted and Debbie. And I understand State Senator Jeremy Ring is here, and I understand that State Representative Jim Waldman is here. (Applause.) It's kind of a busman's holiday for you all, but thank you very much for being here.\nFolks, this is the second of four speeches that I'll be making this spring on what's at stake from our perspective, what's at stake for the middle class in this election. The issue I'm going to focus on today with your permission is retirement security. But I have to tell you, I come at this issue of retirement security from a slightly different angle, a slightly different perspective than it's usually talked about.\nMy dad used to have an expression. He'd say, Joe -- when someone would say, this is what I value and my dad would look at him and say, don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget and I will tell you what you value. Don't tell me what you value, show me your budget and I will tell you what you really value.\nLike many of you here, I had the privilege of having my mom and dad live with me in their -- my dad's final months and my mom's final years. Neither my siblings nor I -- just like when you had your parents and were helping them, neither my siblings nor I could separate the security of my mom and dad from our own well being. Neither my siblings nor I could separate the needs of our parents from the needs of our children. This is all family. This is all about -- it's not just seniors or just the young. We talk about it like it's an either/or proposition. This is about who we are as a people. This is about what we value.\nThat's how our parents lived their lives and how we lived ours. I was raised in my mom and dad's house. And I can say, with the single exception of a two-year period through my entire youth, there was never a time in our three-bedroom home one of my parents' relatives did not live with us, like many of you as you grew up, because there was no alternative. And I think that's what's really missing in this debate today, how connected -- the connective tissue here, the notion that we're all in this together, every generation -- every generation.\nThere is no question that the baby boom generation, which I was at the front end of, puts incredible pressure on Medicare and Social Security. The number of seniors will be doubling by the year 2040. So the question is are we going to strengthen and sustain these programs of Medicare and [Medicaid] now and for the future or are we going to use these challenges -- it's a real challenge, are we going to use these challenges as a pretense to do what so many have been trying to do from the beginning, dismantle both of these programs?\nI said to the overflow room, which were kind enough to come -- and I went to see them before I came to see you. At the end of the day -- we're all old enough, we've been around enough to know that it's not just what you hear, it's not just what you see, but what you feel, what you taste, what your heart tells you -- what your heart tells you about whether or not someone speaking to you means what they say. The one good aspect of growing older is that mechanism in this gets more acute. We understand better.\nThe President and I believe that every American, after a lifetime of hard work, should be able to look forward to the security and dignity that Social Security and Medicare provide. (Applause.) And you know, folks, it's about dignity. It's not just about health. It's about dignity. It's about our dignity.\nIf we had any doubt about the clarity of the choice, just how high the stakes are with regard to both these programs, we got a reminder a couple of days ago from a good man -- he is a decent, smart guy, a guy named Congressman Ryan, a Republican in the House of Representatives. No, no -- I disagree fundamentally with him. But this is not a -- this is a smart, decent guy. But they have a totally different view than the President and I have.\nHe is the Republican leader on what the budget should look like. This week, Congressman Ryan reintroduced what was called the Republican budget, embraced by every Republican candidate for President and passed overwhelmingly by the Republicans in the Congress. They voted for it. He and they made a clear choice. The choice they made was in order to save \"the programs,\" they lowered the standard of living for those on Medicare rather than asking the wealthiest among us to help deal with the problem.\nYou may remember the first Ryan budget -- nothing subtle about it, nothing subtle about it. It dismantled Medicare, within 10 years it was a voucher system. It dismantled the system and meant that the average senior would be paying another $6,000 a year out of pocket for the Medicare benefits they now receive. And the reaction of the nation wasn't very subtle either.\nSo after an overwhelming rejection of the last year Ryan Republican budget plan, they went to work to draw up a new one. But if you take a look at it, they really didn't change anything they're trying to do. And so, if you don't change much on the substance, well, what changed? What's the difference between these two budgets that have been introduced? Well, it's the way they talk about it, literally the way they talk about.\nAnd don't take my word for this. All of you are adept with computers. Go online to an outfit called politico.com -- an extremely well respected publication that all the major papers look to. Go on politico.com and read an article that's in yesterdays or the day before -- it says how Paul Ryan sold his budget plan. He sold it to all of his Republican colleagues by telling them there's a new way to talk about what they're going to do without getting hurt politically.\nHe told them, he told his colleagues, that they could win this debate this time with essentially the same plan if you use \"the right poll-tested words.\" If you use \"the right poll\" -- now, again, don't take my word for it. Go look at the article. He said, if you use words like bipartisan, if you use phrases like fix Medicare, if you use phrases like choice, the American people will not punish you for being for this plan. The American people, though, especially us -- where we are in our lives -- we're not about to be fooled.\nI have more faith in the American people than I think our Republican colleagues do of being able to cut the wheat from the chaff here and see what's going on. (Applause.)\nLook, folks, the vast majority of the American people -- whether they're Democrats, Republicans, or independents -- know there is a fundamental difference between us and the Republicans on this issue. We believe in strengthening Medicare, they don't. Make no mistake about it, if the Republicans in Congress -- and their amen corner of Romney, Santorum, and Gingrich -- if any one of them gets their hands on the White House, the keys of the White House, I promise you will see Medicare ended as you know it.\nAnd it's not just about what they want to do to Medicare. It's about the other benefits for seniors that they want to undo. We passed a law that has been referenced already to close the donut hole -- a significant portion closed already, but it will be totally closed when this law comes fully into effect in 2014, saving the average senior with high drug costs $600 just this last year alone. And that will increase. They want to repeal it. They simply say they want to repeal it.\nWe passed a law that provides for preventative services -- Debbie talked about it. I can remember sitting there -- and thank God my mother had at least one -- two financially successful children, not me. (Laughter.) Well, when my mom lived with me, my mom -- we'd go up and get my mom's prescriptions. And we had to literally lie to mom and tell her, no, all her savings covered everything, because my mom, my mom, she did not want her children having to make sacrifices. But we all chipped in about $6,000 a month all told among us for not only that, but at the very end when my mom needed some care. My mom needed somebody there just to help her with her lunch when she wasn't -- as it got toward the end.\nBut my mom, it was all about her pride. Joey, show me my checkbook. Show me my checkbook. And my brother would quickly run and deposit more money in my mom's checkbook -- (laughter) -- because she had dignity that she wanted to preserve. (Applause.) This is about what these guys don't get. It's more than whether or not my mother and father got the care they needed. It was how they got the care they needed. (Applause.)\nI built a new house. When my kids went off to school, we sold the big house we had and we built another house. And on the ground floor, we put in -- it was sort of on a hill, I built a whole suite for my mom and dad. They would not move in. Joey, my whole life I had someone living with me, which is a great asset for her kids -- my whole life, but I'm not going to do that to my kids. You all know the deal. You know it. You feel it. You taste it. Every one of you feels that way.\nAnd what do they want to do? They want to go in and the ability of my mom just to say, I don't feel well, I'm going to get a checkup, she knew it would cost 20 percent she would have to pay to get that checkup, for the cost of the checkup. And she didn't want to ask her kids. Obviously, if we knew, we'd work out something with the doctor beforehand. But she didn't want to ask her kids.\nHow many times do any one of you feel that pain and you're not sure what it means? How many of you wonder whether or not that thing that just happened to you, is it a harbinger of something more serious? You just want to go ask the doc.\nFolks, these guys want to repeal all that and, in the process, I would argue they'll be repealing that sense of dignity, which is an incredible part of what this is all about. They want to repeal all. They want to repeal all of the things that I've mentioned. The end result is you're going to have to pay at least $600 more a year for your drugs, 20 more percent for your visits to the doctor. You're going to see traditional Medicare change as you know it.\nLook, we'd be so much better off as a country if we spent a lot less time and energy fighting off these efforts to dismantle Medicare, and I mean dismantle it. If we just spent a little more time -- a little more time together, Democrats who are working to figure out how to preserve and strengthen Medicare. We can make Medicare solvent again. We don't have to gut it to make it last.\nLook, in our health care law we've already extended the life of Medicare and its solvency to the year 2024 just by one thing. We've uncovered or recovered over $10.7 billion just since we've been in -- in waste, fraud, and abuse that we put back into the system. If our Republican colleagues would join us, we could reduce the cost of Medicare by $100 billion just by doing one thing, saying drug companies cannot charge Medicare any more than they charge for any other federal program. (Applause.) Saying they can't charge our elderly any more than they charge our veterans -- that's $100 billion.\nWe could save another $20 billion by asking the very wealthy of us, those who could easily afford health care if they have retirement incomes that are significant to pay a little more. That would add another $20 billion. Look, there's a lot more we can do to save this program, but it requires someone on the other side who wants to preserve the system, really cares about preserving it and not gutting it.\nLook, we're prepared to sit down -- the President and I -- and already have; it was blown up -- sit down and work with our Republican colleagues. You may remember all this talk about the Biden budget talks with the Republicans. We talked about all these things, but not one single thing was able to get done. But if you don't start from the premise that this program, Medicare, must be preserved in its current form.\nLook, folks, Social Security is in better shape. But here again, Republicans have come up with an approach on Social Security that they say \"saves Social Security for the next 75 years.\" And they do it by cutting the benefits -- some salvation.\nA plan like the one that Governor Romney has introduced would cut Social Security benefits for your kids and your grandkids -- it would cut by $2,400 a year the typical worker in their 40s would get by the time they get it, and it would cut by $4,700 a year the Social Security coverage anyone working in their 20s would get by the time they retire.\nAnd here's the thing -- here's another thing, nobody has really noticed. Governor Romney and the rest have supported also a thing that the Republican leaders call \"cut, cap, and balance.\" They call it \"cut, cap, and balance.\" Now, that's another one of those new Republican Party plans which would --probably are the right tested words. Who can be against cut, cap, and balance? Except nobody knows what it really means. Nobody knows exactly what they intend, because like so many of the most damaging things, it looks and sounds innocuous.\nSo let me cut through -- no pun intended -- and tell you what it means in plain English. The cut are significant cuts in Social Security benefits. They'll tell you, don't worry, you won't be cut -- you won't be cut, as if all you care about is yourself. See, the thing that I get angry about -- they look at people like you and me, and they think all we care about -- after all you've done for the nation is that all we care about is ourselves after a lifetime -- a lifetime -- of you not only caring for yourselves, but caring for all those people you love, caring for your community. (Applause.)\nAnd they turn around and say, no, no -- as long as we tell you, you won't be cut, you won't mind if your children, you won't mind if your grandchildren, you won't mind if your younger neighbors and friends end up having to pay.\nThey don't understand us. Look, the cap they talk about is the cap on what we ask of the wealthiest Americans, the top percentage of Americans and what they pay to make this country work.\nAnd the balance they talk about is they balance the budgets on the backs of seniors and middle-class Americans. Why? So that they can preserve -- this is not your father's Republican Party, guys, so that they can preserve a trillion dollar tax cut, a new trillion dollar tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. And that's not hyperbole, folks. That is not hyperbole. That's what this is about.\nGovernor Romney supports cut, cap, and balance, which is yet another demonstration that there is no daylight between Governor Romney and the Republican leaders on the most important issues facing this country. And not even Romney's Etch A Sketch can change that. (Laughter and applause.) You're not going to be able to do that. I mean, he may buy a new one but he can't do it.\nFolks, we can resolve the challenges Social Security faces and we can do it in good faith. We did it before. I was there. In 1983, it looked like Social Security was going to run out of money. Remember? It was coming to an end. In 1983, I sat down in a room as one of the junior guys with leaders like Republican Bob Dole, Bill Roth, Chairman of the Finance Committee, President Ronald Reagan, Democrats like Pat Moynihan and Tip O'Neill. And we shook hands. We shook hands. Everybody gave something. And we preserved the system through 2028. Together we solved it for generations at that time.\nLook, folks, you know in your gut -- you know in your gut what I know, it's about willing -- being willing to put politics aside just for a moment, just put it aside for a moment to preserve the single most, significant and consequential government initiative in American history, Social Security.\nLook, some of you remember, I remember -- these two guys won't remember. (Laughter.) But some of you and I remember, we don't remember a day when we didn't have Social Security, but we remember a day when our grandparents didn't have Medicare. And remember what it meant? Remember what it meant? We remember.\nLook, what we need today is just a temporary, like they say in grade school, a timeout, just a timeout. And so, okay, what are we going to do to deal with preserving both these programs? And that's what's missing this time, folks. It was there in 1981 and '82 and '85 and '89. Because today's new Republican Party is fixed on one thing: additional tax cuts for the very wealthy.\nWhen we tried to put 400,000 teachers back to work and 18,000 cops back to work because the city budgets are being crunched, we said, okay, we'll have a .5 of 1 percent tax on every dollar after the first million you make. That would have paid for the whole thing. No Republican would vote for that. Millionaires were calling me saying they were for it. I come from the wealthy state of Delaware. The people up there, the people who have the money knew they should be paying just a little more to preserve that.\nFolks, these guys won't budge a single inch on a trillion dollar problem. Look, we know we have to bring our budget back into balance. It was a Democratic President who last balanced the budget, I'll remind you all of. (Applause.)\nAnd, folks, the day that President Obama and I were sworn in -- the day we were sworn in, that magnificent day on January 20th, looking out a million people on the mall, watching, we were handed that day a gigantic deficit and an economy that was in free fall, and we moved ahead. We moved ahead to get the economy moving again, but we also moved ahead to begin to cut the deficit.\nLast year with the help of my two colleagues, we cut spending by $1 trillion. We also made a deal -- we also made a deal with our Republican friends to cut it by another $1.2 trillion and set up that super committee, remember? What did they come up with? Nothing.\nAnd we were on our way, on the cusp of negotiating -- I was doing most of the negotiation for an agreement that would have cut the overall deficit by $4 trillion. But the Republicans, they walked away from it. Why? Because they wanted to maintain every major tax cut for the very wealthiest and have them move in perpetuity.\nLook, they wanted an additional trillion dollars in tax cuts. And I want to explain to you -- when you say that, it's like, a trillion, that doesn't -- I mean a trillion, I can't even -- you can't even calculate that.\nLet me put it this way, of that trillion dollars, $813 million of that trillion dollar tax cut will go to households making over $1 million a year. Three hundred and fifty -- 315,000 of the wealthiest families in America, average income $3.1 million a year, would get a $100,000 tax break per year for the next 10 years through that.\nLook, we're not asking anybody very wealthy to change their standard of living. We're not -- no serious. We're not asking them to do anything they can't do now. On $3.1 million, you don't need another $100,000 to maintain your home, to drive the vehicle you drive, to vacation where you want to vacation. But when we ask you to take a 20 percent cut or a 30 percent cut in your Medicare or your Social Security or your children, that changes the standard of living.\nLadies and gentlemen, we don't think it's fair, and we don't think it's right. And more importantly, we don't think it's in the interest of the economic growth of this country. Folks, it's simple math, either preserve Medicare and fix Social Security and draw down the deficit, or you spend another trillion dollars on tax cuts for the wealthiest. You can't do both of these things. You can't do both, and we refuse -- we refuse to shift the burden and responsibility of putting America's fiscal house in order on the backs of those who will have to change their standard of living, who have played by the rules, who have worked hard all their life and have earned the retirement benefits they're getting. (Applause.)\nLadies and gentlemen, like so many of you I came from a family where Medicare and Social Security made the difference in the lives of the people I love the most. I'm not sure, as I said, that these guys remember what it was like when folks didn't have Medicare. But I can remember -- a lot of you can remember it, as I said, and it wasn't an era -- it's not an era that we want to go back to again. Without Social Security, nearly half of American seniors, 17 million men and women would be struggling in poverty, just that -- just that alone.\nBefore Medicare, nearly half of all Americans, age 65, lacked health care, one-half of all Americans lacked health care. These programs have afforded the elderly a sense -- and I don't like the world elderly anymore, man. (Laughter.) I'm not big on that word, are you? I don't like that elderly.\nI mean for years I used to rip up the AARP bulletins I got. (Laughter.) But I'm not ripping up my Social Security checks, you know what I mean? (Laughter.) But I don't like elderly -- those of us who are more mature. Those of us who are more mature. (Applause.)\nBut I tell you what, it's about -- it's about our independence. It's about the dignity everybody craves. They argue that cutting now is the only way to save programs for the next generation -- I read an article in the paper today here about that. That's not how I see it. Retirement is multigenerational. It's a matter -- it matters to your children if you have a decent retirement. Every one of you -- it matters to your children. Because if you don't, your children feel obliged to step up. Caring for a parent is a privilege and one that any honorable child will try to undertake. But for some families it would come at an incredibly high cost because they're struggling so badly themselves.\nThe cost for my family was de minimis because of the circumstance my mom's four children were in. But there's a lot of families you know that can't get their kid to college, they're having trouble paying the mortgage, they're out of a job, and the added burden of looking at mom and dad and knowing they don't have the health care they need or having to make these choices that you talked about when you go into the drugstore. That's something that is multigenerational.\nWhen families are stretched thin, it forces very hard choices. And I say families -- not when we are stretched thin, when our children as well are stretched thin. So, folks, this is about more than the monthly payment or access to health care, it's about who we are.\nThe last thing my mother and father wanted to do was be a burden to me, my brothers or my sister or to our children. Social Security and Medicare helped them live independently right to the very end, preserve their dignity, and most importantly from my dad's perspective, his pride.\nSo when these guys in the name of saving the next generation choose to cut Social Security and voucherize Medicare rather than asking for shared responsibility from all, they're not saving the next generation, they're thrusting an incredible burden on the next generation. And they're thrusting it on them right now. (Applause.)\nThey're making it even harder for the middle class at a time when we know if we were -- if we want our economy to be strong, the middle class has to be strong. They're tearing the bonds that connect us, generation to generation at the very moment we should be strengthening those bonds.\nLadies and gentlemen, this year you're going to make some choices about what you want -- who you want to lead this country and who will speak up for you and speak in the way you want on this and many other issues.\nOn this issue, I ask you to do one thing, as I said in the beginning, when you look at Barack and me, when you look at our opponents, take our measure. I used to say when I ran as a kid, look me over. If you like what you see, vote for me. If not, vote for the other guy. (Laughter.) But look us over, and look into your heart. Look into your heart, and ask yourself the question after all the speeches are done: Who do you believe? Who do you believe is genuinely committed to preserving the dignity of people in terms of their health care and their basic, basic ability to live?\nThank you all, very, very much. (Applause.) I love you. Thanks for having me.\n",

(Applause.)\nMr. Mayor, thank you for flying back from Brazil and getting off a plane and coming straight here. If I were you, I'd be home in bed trying to catch up on my sleep. And I want to tell you something, I know I'm back in Iowa when the guy introducing you from the factory floor speaks better than you do, I know I'm back in -- I know I'm back in Iowa. (Laughter and applause.) Incredible state. You're an incredible state.\nI understand the Mayor of Eldridge is here and -- Martin O'Boyle. Terry, thank you for the opportunity of allowing me on the factory floor here, and I understand the chancellor of Eastern Iowa Community College, Don Doucette, is here. Don, where are you? Thank you very much, Don. I'm going to talk about what you guys are doing in just a minute.\nAnd, folks, first of all, as it relates to the story that was just told by Chuck, it reminds me, my dad used to have an expression. He'd say -- I mean this sincerely, a guy who had lost jobs, a guy who had to move and move his family -- he said, Joey, you got to understand one thing, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about your respect. It's about your sense of yourself. It's about your place in the community.\nAnd too many people have been stripped of their dignity as a consequence of this God-awful recession we've inherited. And we're determined -- we're determined -- I think all of us, Republican and Democrat -- are determined to turn that around.\nBut first I want to thank -- I want to thank Terry, the president of PCT, and I also want to thank the community college for doing what is a remarkable thing that's happening all across America, for partnering -- for partnering with this great company and producing jobs, making sure the skills available match the needs.\nLadies and gentlemen, I come here today with a very, very simple message: Manufacturing is back. Manufacturing is back. (Applause.)\nAnd, folks, that's not only good news for Chuck and all the fellow workers here on this factory floor, it's good news for America. But it's even better news for America's middle class. (Applause.) They've taken an awful beating over the last decade or more, and what's happened just in the last couple years: 430,000 new manufacturing jobs just since 2010; more than 15,000 new manufacturing jobs here in the state of Iowa; the fastest growth in manufacturing since the '90s.\nAfter years of hearing the word outsourcing, our children are going to hear a new word as much as we heard outsourcing. It's called insourcing. It's called insourcing. (Applause.)\nBecause, folks, the facts are -- and you're going to see more of them -- the facts are that the jobs that left the United States are coming back to the United States. Plants that closed are opening, opening and reinvented. Companies like John Deere expanding here in Davenport and in Waterloo and in Des Moines, where they added nearly 500 new jobs in the past two years, good paying jobs. Siemens Wind employs 500 people at Fort Madison. Sixty-five percent of them used to work in companies in the area that are either closed or downsized. So, folks, America is coming back. It's not a political slogan; it's a reality. And it's happening in the sector that built the middle class in manufacturing.\nLook, you know a lot of my Republican friends and some of our political opponents wonder why the President and I have spent so much time working to bring manufacturing back. No one in the Heartland has to wonder about that. You all know why. You all know why because you were the manufacturing center of the world, and you saw what happened when those jobs were lost.\nYou know that manufacturing jobs just aren't any old jobs. They are good paying jobs; jobs you can raise a family on. Jobs that allow you to own a home and not just rent; jobs that give you the promise of being able to send your kid to college. And here in Iowa, the average manufacturing job pays almost $50,000 a year. And they're jobs that matter to everyone, as was mentioned by Chuck, because they not only are good for America -- they're good for America, because they make America competitive again. And they're jobs of building products of the future in industries of the future for an economy that's able to compete for the future, products like the electronic beam systems built here at PCT -- remarkable.\nThese are jobs building products that export to consumers not just here but all around the world, expanding world markets for the United States of America. You know about that too. Fifty percent -- all the workers here know that 50 percent of what they produce here at PCT Engineering are sales that are destined to be exported. That's a big deal.\nThey're jobs that anchor our communities. They're jobs that get the local community moving again, manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs create more jobs, other jobs -- jobs in diners, hardware stores, schools, police departments. But most importantly, they're jobs that can help rebuild the middle class, which has been battered. And nobody knows it better than all of you.\nLook, it matters because real growth, growth that is widely shared, the only growth that really matters -- growth that is widely shared by everyone in this country -- can only happen when the middle class is growing again. When the middle class is growing, everyone does well. The wealthy do very well, as they should, and those who are not wealthy have a shot, a ladder maybe they can climb up to change their circumstance.\nBut the middle class will only grow if we build an economy that can support the middle class. And manufacturing is not the only part, but it's a critical part to bringing back the middle class. And no one knows that better than the people of Iowa, who know the essential role that -- it's not only manufacturing. Look at Iowa and agriculture and the role agriculture plays in the economic health and well-being of this nation. That's why the President and I are so proud that last year farm exports reached a record high of $137 billion, $23 billion higher than ever before.\nThat's not only good for the economic well-being of Iowa farmers, it's good for the economic well-being of the entire country. And with the new trade agreements the President negotiated, we expect an additional $2.3 billion in the coming years in agricultural products supporting an additional 20,000 jobs here at home. But it's not only the agricultural sector that's going to benefit from these new trade agreements. It will create tens of thousands of more jobs in manufacturing in the high-tech sector because of these agreements.\nAnd, folks, we're not just fighting harder to be able to export our products -- agriculture or manufactured -- abroad. They're important, but we're fighting to export complex, high-tech services as well, services that Americans provide better than any other people in the world, but things most people don't think about -- (applause) -- things most don't think about, that they contribute and contribute tens of billions of dollars to our economy like construction, engineering, health care technology, IT. We do that better than anyone in the world.\nWe recently signed an agreement, after my negotiations with the Vice President of China, opening America's automobile insurance industry to the largest automobile market in the world. You say, what does that have to do? If you have access for American automobile insurance companies to sell insurance, which has been blocked up to now, in China to the largest number of folks in the world who drive automobiles, that's real money. That's real jobs. That's real jobs back here at home.\nBut ultimately, it all comes down to the same question, the real question, quite frankly, of this election and the challenge of our time -- will we be a country that values the role of workers in the success of businesses and values the middle class in the success of the economy or are we going to move backwards to the same disastrous philosophy that rewarded speculators rather than builders?\nLook, this is the third in a series of speeches I'm giving on behalf of our administration laying out the stark choices we believe the American people are going to face in November and what's at stake for the middle class. Today, I want to focus primarily on manufacturing because President Obama and I -- President Obama and I have been working to rebuild our manufacturing sector and rebuild our country because we think they're one and the same. We don't know how you do one without the other. We don't know how you leave it out, manufacturing and rebuild the country.\nSo let me tell you what we've done, but maybe equally as important, let me tell you what we think we have to do, what more we have to do. When we came into office, the manufacturing sector, had been neglected badly and was getting devastated.\nDuring the 2000s, before we came in, 5.8 million manufacturing jobs were lost in the United States of America. Right here in Iowa, you lost 53,000 manufacturing jobs. You saw companies like Maytag and Electolux and many others close shop. Thousands of factories closed out and laid off workers, a lot of them reopened in places like Vietnam, Mexico, China, \"cheaper markets.\" And we were told -- how many times have you been told over the last 15 years that America's days as a leading manufacturer in the world had passed?\nLook, the President and I said, where is it written, where is it written that says our day has passed in anything? The President and I fundamentally disagreed with that proposition. And by the way, it was a widely held proposition, not just with our friends on the other side, with a whole lot of people.\nWe knew -- we knew we had to get manufacturing back on its feet again because for every one of those manufacturing jobs lost, somebody lost their place in the middle class. For every one of those jobs lost.\nSo we went to work first and foremost over significant opposition, and with Mitt Romney arguing that we should let Detroit go bankrupt.\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Booo!\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: What we did is we rescued the auto industry. We administered some of the very toughest medicine -- (Applause.) We were criticized by many on our side. We administered some very tough medicine, but together we saved literally 1 million jobs.\nAnd since restructuring, the industry has already added back another 200,000 jobs and GM is leading the world again as the world's largest automobile manufacturer. (Applause.)\nFolks, we knew that was essential, but not enough, so we went to work to provide a skilled workforce for companies that have already come back or are bringing their folks back. We met with the leading companies in the world who came to the White House in January. They pointed out to us that right now there are 600,000 manufacturing jobs in the United States that companies who have come back home can't fill because of their inability to match the workers' skills with the need of the companies.\nSo we launched a partnership between what my wife, Jill, who is a community college professor, calls the best-kept secret -- (Applause.) Beautiful. What my wife, Jill, calls the best-kept secret in America, American community colleges. And businesses looking to fill those 600,000 slots married up with them.\nWe've also proposed an $8 billion partnership to give more momentum to this effort. My wife and the Secretary of Labor, Secretary Solis, just did an 800-mile bus trip, starting off in Iowa, working all the way -- their way through Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina, visiting community college and business after community college and business, providing hundreds and hundreds of good paying jobs because they're training directly, exactly what the companies need.\nAnd it was all over the countryside, from Tennessee, to North Carolina, to Michigan, Ohio, New Hampshire, and it's working. So let me say it again, thank you, Terry. And thank you, Dr. Paper, and thank you, Chancellor -- Dr. Paper, and thank you, Chancellor, for this partnership of yours. You are one of the reasons why. You're literally one of the reasons why American companies are now insourcing instead of outsourcing.\nWe've committed to breaking down barriers that block access of American products to overseas markets, so the rest of the world and the consumers can understand what we already know, that we make the best products. No one makes a better product than American workers, and there's no worker in the world more productive than an American worker. That's not hyperbole. That is a fact. That is literally a fact. (Applause.)\nIn addition, the President has signed into law three free trade agreement with Korea, Colombia and Panama. They're going to open up markets for the best products in the world -- for the best products in the world, Made in America products, to all those countries, which now can't get into those countries and are committed to leveling the playing field across the board.\nTo that end, we created for the first time a thing we call the Trade Enforcement Unit, whose sole job is to crack down on countries that pursue unfair trade practices. We're not -- we don't think that's a trade war. We think that's a fair way to trade. And so just this month, we brought a new trade case against China.\nChina is unfairly limiting American access to so-called rare earth materials that they possess, that are needed by American manufacturers to make high-tech products like electronic vehicles and advanced electronics.\nWe changed the tax code to give a 30 percent tax credit to a company that builds wind turbines, solar panels or other clean energy products here in the United States rather than abroad. (Applause.) The result so far -- the result so far is $2.3 billion of new investment in factories built here in the United States of America, rather than abroad. (Applause.)\nLook, even more to come as they invest in new plants and equipment right now, right now if they invest, by allowing them to write off more rapidly the cost of the factory, the cost of the equipment, the cost of their vehicles so they can expand opportunities. That means more people being hired.\nThe bottom line is we're changing the paradigm here. We're rewarding instead of penalizing American companies that invest in building and hiring here in America, and manufacturers are responding. They're hiring workers by the hundreds of thousands. They're exploiting products all around the world.\nWith this added incentive, we're on pace to double, as the President committed to, double American exports by the year 2015. And let me translate what that means, if we double American exports by the year 2015, that creates another 2 million American jobs. (Applause.)\nSo, folks -- so all those skeptics and our Republican opponents who -- especially don't tell me that America can't make things anymore; can't compete in the world market anymore; can't lead the world again any more. We will lead the world again in every aspect of the economy. (Applause.)\nAnd, folks, we've already begun. You've begun -- not me -- you've begun, and we're not done. For years, American manufacturers have faced one of the highest tax rates in the world. We want to reduce that by over 20 percent. We want to drop the rate particularly for high-tech manufacturers like you, Mr. President, even further than the 20 percent. We want to create what's called a global minimum tax, because American taxpayers shouldn't be providing a larger subsidy for investing abroad than investing at home. (Applause.)\nLook, we want to end and we want to end it right now, the practice of getting a tax break, which you saw happen here in Iowa for dismantling a factory, floor to ceiling, and shipping it abroad and getting a moving expense to go abroad. Instead, we should be giving a tax credit to companies that dismantle factories abroad and bring them back home. (Applause.)\nLook, this and a lot of other ways is why we're bringing American manufacturing back and it's how we're going to grow the middle class. Look, folks, conventional wisdom that manufacturing is dead in this country is dead wrong -- dead wrong -- and we've got to maintain this momentum. But if you'll forgive me for saying this, one thing that could bring this momentum to a screeching halt is turning over the keys of the White House to Santorum or Romney. (Applause.)\nLook, they're both good guys. They're both good guys and I've worked with Rick for a long time. Senator Santorum is the only one of them who is even claiming to care about manufacturing, but his Senate record tells a different story. He voted against ending loopholes for companies that move manufacturing jobs offshore, from America offshore. And just like Mitt Romney, when asked if we should have rescued the automobile industry, he said, \"No, absolutely not.\"\nBut if Senator Santorum has been inconsistent in what he has said and what he has done, Mitt Romney has been remarkably consistent -- (laughter) -- as an investor/businessman, as the governor of Massachusetts, and now as a candidate for President, remarkably consistent and I respectfully suggest, consistently wrong. (Applause.)\nLadies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, when he was CEO of Bain Capital, Bain Capital closed down two factories in South Florida that made medical devices, moving the production to Germany. They shut down a plant in South Carolina and cut jobs in another one in Rhode Island that made photo albums and picture frames and outsourced production overseas. I'm tempted to say, Mitt, thanks for the memories. (Laughter.) You know what I mean?\nAs governor of Massachusetts, he repeatedly slashed funding for workforce training in manufacturing specifically. And despite the fact that millions of taxpayer dollars were flowing to companies outsourcing state services like overseas call centers, he vetoed a bill passed by the Massachusetts legislature that would have stopped the state from outsourcing contracts overseas, state contracts.\nLook, think about it, a Massachusetts taxpayer with a question -- this is how it works -- with a question about Massachusetts state services, picks up the phone, dials an 800 number expecting to talk to somebody in the Massachusetts government to get an answer to their question. And instead, he talking to -- or she's talking to someone on the other side of the world and all of it paid for by his or her tax dollars. I find that kind of fascinating. (Laughter.) No, I really mean it. I mean, that's one when I was told about, I said, I'm not going to say that until you fact check that for me again.\nBut think about it, it's one thing for the local company to outsource a call service, but for the state government to outsource a call service that's set up to answer questions for people in the state about a problem they have with the government, to outsource that, denying folks in Massachusetts the jobs that are attendant to that? Is it any surprise to you that Massachusetts, under Governor Romney, was losing manufacturing jobs twice as fast as the rest of the country?\nNow, as a presidential candidate, he has proposed a new international tax system that zeroes out taxes for companies that create jobs outside the United States of America. I'm not making this stuff up.\nLook, your -- President Obama and Governor Romney, Joe Biden, and whoever the nominee is going to be, we are talking about taxes and the burden on manufacturers. But there's a big difference. Our tax cuts go to companies that create jobs over here. The Romney tax cut goes to companies that create jobs overseas. It's a fundamentally different philosophy from ours.\nWhen China was dumping tires into the international marketplace, hurting American manufacturers of tires and their workers, President Obama stepped up and enforced our trade laws and won. Governor Romney, at the time, called what the President has done protectionism. That's his quote -- \"protectionism.\" Now, when it's politically expedient, he wants to get really tough on China.\nLook, it's a different philosophy. Governor Romney has called the President of the United States \"out of touch\" -- that's a quote, \"out of touch\" -- for encouraging young people to try to get manufacturing jobs. Out of touch? Romney? (Laughter and applause.) I mean, pretty remarkable, pretty remarkable. As an old friend of mine says, that's chutzpah. (Laughter.) Look, the Wall Street Journal wrote, \"Romney appeared to scoff first in Detroit, then in Florida at the notion of manufacturing as a job engine for the future.\"\nSo, look, folks, we have a choice in this election between our philosophy that believes manufacturing is central to our economy and their philosophy that scoffs at it, between our philosophy that says there is nothing out of touch about fighting for the future of the middle class by creating manufacturing jobs -- a philosophy that says if the folks at the top -- and their philosophy says if the folks at the top do well, everything else will do well. How many times have you heard about the job creators?\nLook, Governor Romney's business practices and his policies have clearly benefited the wealthy and most powerful among us, often at the expense of working and middle-class families. They actually believe it's the best way. I'm not doubting their belief. But it just doesn't work that way.\nAs the President said, and I quote, \"this\" -- meaning the middle class -- \"this is the defining issue of our time. This is a make-or-break moment for the middle class, and for all those who are fighting to get into the middle class.\"\nFolks, I stood outside of a lot of plant gates in my career, both here in this state, the state of Iowa, and in my home state of Delaware, shaking hands and asking for support. I've also stood outside those gates -- like the General Motors gate of my home state -- asking those -- when those workers needed my help because the plant was shutting down, going somewhere else. Those are the days that stick with me the most in my career.\nThose are the days when the longest walk that these folks were taking wasn't from the factory floor to the parking lot for the last time, it was up that flight of stairs they had to go up once they got home into their child's bedroom to say, Honey, I'm sorry but you're not going to be able to go back to Roosevelt High School, or St. Mary's, or not be able to be in that little league; Daddy, Mommy, I lost my job. We've got to do something else.\nMy dad made that walk when I was young. An awful lot of kids heard the same words I heard, except the difference between then and now was that my father said everything was going to be okay. In the mid '50s he believed it, and I believed it. So many people have made that walk in the recent past five, six, seven years, and they can't even say with certainty when they look at their child up until now, it's going to be okay.\nBut the good news is that today, hundreds of thousands of workers are replacing that longest walk with walks of a totally different journey. (Applause.) A journey that ends with workers who are able to come home and say, I've got a job -- just like you were. (Applause.) I've got a job.\nThey've been able to say, I've got a good job building amazing products that the world wants to buy. That's what makes me so optimistic. We've got a way to go yet, but knowing these journeys are taking place again in the thousands -- more of them every single day.\nLook, some of you know me fairly well. My entire career I've been characterized as an optimist, since I got elected as a 29-year-old kid to the Senate. Well, I've got to tell you, I mean this sincerely, I've never been more optimistic in my life about the prospects for America. (Applause.) America today is better positioned than any country in the world to lead the 21st Century. (Applause.)\nFolks, it's not just manufacturing that's coming back. The middle class is coming back. America is coming back. Worker by worker, home by home, neighborhood by neighborhood, the country is coming back. So as my grandpop would say, keep the faith. And thank you. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. (Applause.)\n",

    "text": "\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello, New Hampshire. (Applause.) Diedre -- I told Diedre, I should say amen and sit down. (Laughter.) And I told Diedre, we have something in common. I drove a school bus too, when I was in law school to help pay my way, and now I'm kind of an administrative assistant, as well. (Laughter and applause.) And so we got a lot in common.\nLook, it's great to back in New Hampshire and to see -- I can't see a lot faces because of the lights, but back here I see a number of familiar faces, and up there I see a number of familiar faces, and it's great to be back with you all. (Applause.)\nYou know over the past few weeks, I've given a series of speeches on behalf of the President and myself about what's at stake for the middle class and why the choice in this election is so fundamental. I've spoken about the rescue of the automobile industry, the American automobile industry; about retirement security and having America lead the world again in manufacturing. And today, I want to speak about a fourth topic that's going to impact significantly on -- with the other three -- on the state of the middle class in America, and that is the tax system.\nAll of these issues touch the most fundamental issue of all: How do we rebuild an economy with a strong and growing middle class? That's the challenge. As the President says, that's the challenge of our time.\nWhen all is said and done, this campaign we're on is going to really boil down to a very simple question: Are we going to rebuild an economy with a middle class that's growing and not shrinking? And we are going to restore the value that says, in America if you work hard, you can get ahead, that personal responsibility will be rewarded, that everyone -- everyone -- from Main Street to Wall Street will play by the same rules?\nWe are as a country going to make I believe the responsible choice to ensure that that kind of future we want for our children is back within reach for our children. Because you know the neighborhoods you grew up in, so many parents today of young children have doubt unlike we had raising our children that if they played by those rules, if they did it by the numbers, if they worked hard, they could be certain that they'd provide that opportunity for their children. That's what this is really all about.\nAnd part of the debate is about the tax system we have, and the subject that's on everyone's mind as April 15th approaches. President Obama and I believe that it's simply wrong to have a system that's so riddled with loopholes and preferences that the wealthiest and most successful of all Americans often pay at a lower rate -- at a lower rate of their taxes than average middle-class people do.\nWarren Buffett who many people in America have come to know as an extremely successful, generous and gregarious man who shined a very, very bright light on this subject about -- when he noted the absurd fact that he, as a billionaire under the current tax laws, pays actually at a lower tax rate than his secretary pays.\nBut the thing is he's not alone. There are tens of thousands and several millions of people who are in that same situation that -- making over a million dollars do the same exact thing. It happens all the time because the law allows it and because we are fortunate enough to -- they're fortunate enough to hire good accountants and lawyers who know who to take full advantage of every aspect of the tax code.\nAnd so as we start, we have -- we decided how do we gain this -- how do we begin to get this back under control? How do we being to right the ship here so middle-class people have an even chance?\nAnd to start, we started by proposing what we call the Buffett Rule to ensure that no one who makes a million dollars or more in any single given year will pay at an effective tax rate that's less than 30 percent. It's simply a matter of fairness.\nBut more than that, it's also, I would argue, a matter of common sense. Let me read you a quote, and this is a quote from someone else: \"Just a moment ago, I told some people about a letter I just received. It's a letter from a man out there in the country, an executive who's earning six figures, well above a hundred thousand dollars a year. He wrote me,\" it goes on to say, in support of my -- \"in support of the tax plan because he said, I am legally able to take advantage of the present tax code, nothing dishonest, doing what the law prescribes and wind up paying a smaller tax than my secretary pays. That letter wasn't written to Warren Buffett. That letter was written to and read by President Ronald Reagan.\nThe person went to say, \"and I'd like to be able to come to Washington to be able to testify before the Congress to explain to them how I do that and why it's wrong.\"\nLook, I remember -- I remember a time not too long ago when President Clinton was President of the United States, and when he left office, he left America with an enormous surplus and an enormous projected surplus. I was proud to have been in the Senate at the time and helped him accomplish that goal.\nBut then Washington made a series of really bad choices after he left: Two huge tax cuts, two huge tax cuts, neither of which were paid for, skewed overwhelmingly to the very wealthiest Americans of all; two wars -- two wars -- carried on the books, not a single penny paid for either one of those wars; and a [sic] Medicaid drug program worthy but also not paid for. In addition, the Bush administration went on and eviscerated the oversight functions of the federal government, and as a consequence too many investors bet on short-term gains and made extremely risky financial schemes. And you know the result, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\nSo when Barack and I came to office, when we walked in the door at the peak of this crisis, we were handed a $1 trillion bill, deficit projection for that year, which started -- which started in September, the budget year, we were handed a $1 trillion bill before we were -- we had 10 minutes on the job, and the near certainty that we were going to lose several more million jobs before we even could get started with our program -- billions of dollars in lost revenues as a consequence of the Great Recession, coupled with the steps that had to be taken to prevent that recession from turning into a depression, which added more to the deficit.\nAnd now -- now that we turn the corner, we're faced with another choice: Do we pay down those deficits, cutting wherever we can, as we've been doing, while at the same time investing in things we know we must invest in, in order for the economy to grow and create good, middle-class jobs? We know what they are. It's invest in education, research and development, new technologies, clean energy. Or do we continue to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on tax windfalls for millionaires, windfalls they don't need and I might ask, they never asked for it?\nI come from a wealthy little state. I often point out, wealthy people are just as patriotic as poor people. They're just as patriotic as middle-class people, and I think they know -- I think they know they should be doing more.\nAnd now Governor Romney and others argue that if we keep these windfalls and then shower even more windfalls on the very wealthiest, that's how America's economy will grow. That's how we will create jobs. That's their thesis in a nutshell. It amazes. It absolutely amazes me. He offers this prescription as if it's somehow a new idea, folks, like something we haven't seen before; even worse -- like something we haven't actually tried before.\nFolks, we've seen this movie before. You've seen the movie. It does not end well. It does not end well. (Laughter.) Where has he been? (Applause.) Where has he been?\nCould it be that he's out of touch? (Laughter.) I don't know, but I tell you what, he missed the movie. (Laughter.) Although he benefitted from the movie.\nFolks, this is the same argument that was touted out a decade ago by President George Bush to justify the unjustifiable tax cuts for the very wealthy then. And look what happened. It actually had the opposite impact. It produced the slowest job growth in half a century. And during that period from 2000 to 2007, middle-income people actually lost $2,300 in income. They actually retreated, did not grow. But it is true that the very top did very, very, very well. But the impact was our economy faltered, the middle class shrank, the poor got poorer, and ultimately the economy collapsed.\nAnd on whom did it collapse? It collapsed on all of you. It collapsed on the middle class, and it came down with a crash -- $1.7 trillion in lost income -- lost value, the American people. You watched the equities in your homes evaporate. You watched your 401(k)s be eviscerated. That's what it produced, and now Mitt Romney wants to take us down that same road again.\nLet me state it plainly. The President and I are determined to do all in our power to make sure we never go down that road again. (Applause.)\nLook, folks, it really is a simple, straightforward proposition. There's nothing very complicated about this. We believe, as I suspect most of you do, Democrats and Republicans, we believe it's fundamentally unfair to ask some middle-class families to pay more and to lose more opportunity so a millionaire can pay less.\nLook, it's that simple. I don't know any person -- I don't know any reasonable person, regardless of their political background, who disagrees with that proposition. Back when we were trying to put more teachers and cops back on the street, and we had a very small tax -- surtax on the first dollar over a million dollars, the polls showed the vast majority of millionaires thought it was the right thing to do.\nSo I don't buy this argument Republicans offer. I don't buy this argument that the very wealthy aren't prepared to contribute to the recovery in the same way that everybody else is prepared -- they're not prepared. They're not prepared.\nRonald Reagan, Warren Buffett, Diedre, the President -- nobody that I know, no reasonable person, at least in my view thinks this is the American way. In America, we're not supposed to have a system that's rigged. We're not supposed to have a system with one set of rules for the very wealthy and one set of rules for everybody else. And I might add if you notice, we've maintained our position that nobody under $250,000 would have their taxes raised, and where I come from, that's wealthy.\nThis is -- we're talking about the very wealthy. Ladies and gentlemen, time and again, time and again, middle-class Americans have shown their willingness to stand up and do their part in times of political, economic or military crisis -- time and again. But the one thing the neighborhoods I come from and I suspect all of you, the one thing we don't like being played for is a sucker. The one thing we don't like is being played for as a sucker. (Applause.)\nSo when you all pay your taxes next week, you and every citizen in New Hampshire and my home state of Delaware ought to be able to know that everyone one else is paying their fair share, as well. But the truth is you know they're not. The truth is when you pay those taxes you know not everyone is paying their fair share.\nAnd, folks, it's not just the Buffett Rule. The Buffett Rule is not going to solve all problems. It just brings a modicum of fairness at the outset here. If Governor Romney has his way, we'll have the Romney Rule. And I mean it sincerely -- this isn't a cute little deal. There's a Romney Rule. The Romney Rule says, let's double down on the tax cuts for the wealthy.\nLook, folks, it's not -- this is not about -- this not about class warfare; this is about math. This is about math and people's lives. As my dad used to say, and I know the Congressman has heard me say this many times, don't tell me what you value, show me your budget, and I will tell you what you value. Show me your budget and I will tell you what you value. (Laughter and applause.)\nSo let's take a look. Let's take a look. Let's take a look what the Romney Rule values, what the Governor values, and his colleagues. He values Bush tax cuts to be made permanent for the wealthy. The ones that are intended to expire this December, he wants to extend them permanently. That will cost $1 trillion over the next 10 years; $800 billion of that trillion going to people who make a minimum of $1 million. And to add insult to injury, the Romney Rule proposes to give another $250,000-a-year tax cut to the average millionaire, on top of maintaining the Bush tax cuts.\nI know -- if you hadn't watched all the debates, you'd probably think I'm making this up. (Laughter.) But seriously, that's what -- that's what he calls for, the Romney Rule calls for. That's another trillion dollars in tax cuts over the next 10 years going to the top 1 percent of American taxpayers.\n(Baby cries.)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: I don't blame her for crying. She's going to -- (Laughter and applause.) She is going to inherit it. She's going to pay for it. That's one smart baby. (Laughter and applause.)\nLook, folks, let me say it again, the Bush tax cuts for the very wealthy, and the new proposal of a trillion dollars in additional tax cuts. These are tax cuts that folks in that category, the vast majority, didn't ask for. They didn't ask for them. They don't need them to maintain their standard of living. And by the way, I'm being serious about that. The only time people really sacrifice is when they lose a tax break or a tax structure that forces them to change their standard of living. That what changes people -- when you have to move out of your house and rent, instead of own; when you can't send your kid to college and you can only send them to trade school and so on and so forth. But nobody in the category designed to benefit from these tax cuts is going to have to change one, single aspect of their standard of living.\nIt's a stark choice we have to make, a choice between the Romney Rule that I think will take the country -- take the country in a direction that we don't want to go. Look, the Buffett Rule says no one making more than a million dollars will pay a smaller share of their income taxes than middle-class families do. And you'll hear them come back and say, well, the effective tax rate for middle-class families is lower and so on, a lot of what that is said it true, but the bottom line is -- let me put it another way: Anybody making a million dollars can't pay 30 percent in taxes? That's lower than the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already -- not just for millionaires, for people making over $200,000.\nThe Romney Rule says that the very wealthy should keep every tax break and loophole they have and get additional new tax cuts every year that are worth more than what the average middle-class family makes in a year -- in an entire year! And in the neighborhoods -- I asked them to look up what the average income in this area is -- that one -- new $250,000-a-year tax break would be roughly -- if the numbers we were given are right -- somewhere between two -- excuse me, four times greater than the average income of a family in this -- in \"this neighborhood.\" It's just not fair.\nBut beyond being not fair, it is literally bad economic policy. It is bad economic policy. I understand -- we understand rewarding risk. We understand rewarding people who innovate. We understand that. We understand some cases that deserve a different tax treatment to get people to take risks to benefit us all. But let me put this in perspective by giving you an illustration. This summer -- and Diedre just indirectly referenced it -- this summer, the interest rate on student loans is supposed to double, is set to double. We are pushing the Congress to try to hold it at what it is, 3.8 percent. It's going to double now -- unless we enact the President's plan.\nWith the Romney Rule, we couldn't afford to do anything like that. You know what it would mean to middle-class families in New Hampshire with a couple of kids going to college, will see their interest rates double. Just imagine if tomorrow, your interest rate on your car loan doubled, what it means out of your pocket. Imagine tomorrow if the interest rate you're paying on your mortgage doubled. I think these guys don't come from the same place we come from. That makes a difference. It makes a difference in your standard of living. It makes a difference in what you can do for your family. It matters.\nIt's all about the impact of the Romney Rule on the middle class or the Obama-Biden approach. It's about whether or not you're going to be able to afford to send your kids to college, whether or not you can live in a safe neighborhood because there's adequate resources to have sufficient police protection and fire protection. It's about whether or not your mom can pick up all her prescription drugs and not leave two at the counter.\nMy mom was living with me. I didn't even know she was doing it till I followed her to the drug store, literally, and watched my mom say to the druggist, no, Honey, that's okay. I only need four of these. It's about whether or not working moms, as Diedre, can afford not just childcare, decent childcare -- decent childcare.\nLook, in our view the fair way to do this is also the right way to do this, the economically sound way to do this, and that's why the President and I have been talking about this and we'll continue to talk about it for a while.\nLet me tell you what we propose in addition to the Buffett Rule. We laid out a plan to reduce the federal deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade, and people say, well, how do you do that? Well, we do that by making some very painful cuts -- we already cut over a trillion dollars, painful cuts.\nBut we also get that $4 trillion by coming up with $1.5 trillion by ending unnecessary tax breaks for the very wealthy, so our children don't have to carry the burden. That's how we get to $4 trillion. You can't get there without cutting bone and marrow if you don't include the elimination of the tax breaks for the very wealthiest among us.\nIf we put the Buffett Rule in place, let the Bush tax cuts expire for the very wealthy, and reject Romney's additional trillion dollar tax cut for the wealthy, America will be able to do the things we need to do to grow the economy. And you all know -- everyone knows what they are.\nWe can't be the most competitive nation in the world when we rank 16th in the world in the percent of college graduates we have as a nation. We have to invest in education. It is self-evident. But to do that, to do that, you have to say it's more important to help educate hundreds of children or send hundreds of kids to college than to give one billionaire the Romney rule tax cuts because that it would equate to. (Applause.) One, just one. (Applause.)\nAnd you don't even have to go to billionaire. How many kids can we send to college for $250,000 a year, the tax break he wants to add for people making over a million? Look, choices matter. They have consequences. The President and I will make that choice but Mitt Romney will make a different choice.\nWe believe we need to provide tax credits for cutting-edge manufacturing enterprises so Americans will be able to lead the world in the industries of the future, what you're doing up here in New Hampshire -- providing good paying jobs for a growing middle class. But to do that -- to do that, you have to say that creating jobs in America is more important than another tax break for millionaires and billionaires, or for that matter, a tax break that is going to go overseas. (Applause.)\nThe American people know the choice the President and I have made, and we're going to make sure they know the choice the Romney rule is making. Look, Governor Romney and his friends just have a -- they're good people, but they have a fundamentally different economic philosophy than we do.\nIt's -- to put it bluntly, we think it's out of step with basic American values. Now, I'm not calling these guys un-American; they're sound, patriotic Americans. I don't want to hear anybody play that game with me. But it is out of step, at least with the American values, those middle-class values that most of us were raised with. And Governor Romney calls the President out of touch, and anti-woman, by the way but I -- out of touch? Hey, how many of you all have a Swiss bank account? (Laughter and applause.) No one? And how many of you have somewhere between $20 and $100 million in your IRA?\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, I do.\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: All right. I've got to meet you. I've got to meet you. (Applause.) Out of touch? He calls the President out of touch? Look, folks, the President and I -- as I've said before -- we value investment and risk. And risk should be rewarded and investment should be encouraged, but we also value work. We also value the work of our hands and the work of our head. We value the work of the American people because guess what -- when they work, everything is added in value, everything has a higher value.\nLook, this is the basic choice in the election. The President and I are determined to make the economy work for everybody -- everybody. Not just because it's fair -- literally, not just because it's fair. That's reason enough. But we believe, and history shows, when the middle class grows the wealthy get wealthier, the poor have a better shot, the economy is sound and the economy grows. We believe in a fair shot and a fair shake. Governor Romney and those who share his philosophy believe in no rules, no risk when you fail taking a risk, and no accountability.\nFolks, I want to state it very plainly -- the President and I have absolute confidence in the American people. That's not hyperbole. We have absolute confidence in the American people. They have been and continue to be the most innovative and productive people on the planet. That is a fact. We have absolute faith because we know, given the opportunity, they have never, never, never, never failed to step up -- never.\nAnd we also know one other thing: We are better positioned as a nation -- and you should know we are better positioned as a nation, counting every nation -- China, every other nation in the world -- we are better positioned as a nation at this moment to be the leading economy in the 21st century, if we act responsibly, if we invest in our people, if we invest in education, if we invest in innovation, if we invest in new technologies, if we invest in alternative energy. We have absolute confidence.\nAnd one other thing, that although we have a long way to go, we are on the right track. Twenty-five months of growth -- not enough, but we are on the right track. And let me make it clear to you, and I want to say it as plainly as I can, this is no time to turn back.\nGod bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you all so very much. Thank you. (Applause.)\n",

    "text": "\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello, folks. How are you? It's great to be with you all. (Applause.) What a great introduction. I just said I hope she remembers me when she's President of the United States of America. (Laughter.)\nLadies and gentlemen, it's great to be before such a distinguished audience at a great university. I want to start off by doing what the Ambassador will tell you you should never do, apologizing. It's all Jack Lew's fault I'm late. (Laughter.) No, some of you students don't know that the President's Chief of Staff was the CFO here at NYU, and also taught a public policy course, and so that's the only reason he got the job as Chief of Staff. (Applause.) He figured if he could deal with this great university, he can deal with the country.\nAnd it's great to see one of the great, great patriots, one of the finest generals I've ever in my 39 years of working in foreign policy and national security ever met, General Wesley Clark. Great to see you, General. (Applause.)\nI want to just state parenthetically that you know I ran -- not you know, but I ran for the United States Senate when I was 28 years old, and no one in my family on my dad's side had ever been involved in public life. And as one of my colleagues said, I'm the first United States Senator I ever knew.\nAnd I ran at the time because I thought the policy we had in Vietnam, I didn't argue it as immoral, but I thought it just didn't make sense, the notion of dominoes and so on and so forth.\nAnd I came to Washington as a 29-year-old kid. I got elected. Before I was eligible to serve, I had to literally wait to be sworn in because I wasn't eligible under the Constitution. You must be 30 years old. And my image of the military commanders at the time was, if you ever saw that old movie, if you ever rented it, where Slim Pickens is on the back of an atom bomb, dropping out of an aircraft, yelling, Yippe, Kiyay. (Laughter.) And \"Dr. Strangelove\" was the movie.\nBut I have to tell you after all the time I've served in public office, if you asked me who the most impressive women and men that I have met in government in the last 40 years, six of them would be men or women wearing a uniform. It's a different military. This guy was not only a great warrior -- I mean literally a warrior, but this guy is a diplomat. This guy is an incredibly bright man, extremely well educated. He understands the role of the military within our system, and he understands the Constitution.\nAnd there are -- Thank God, there's others like him that are still around today. Wes, thanks for being one of those many folks who changed my impression from my younger years. It's a pleasure to be with you. (Applause.)\nFolks, over the last -- the past months, I've given on behalf of the campaign a series of speeches on major issues in this campaign laying down the markers, at least from our perspective, of the President and mine, the distinguishing differences between the President [sic] and us on a series of issues -- issues that we believe affect the middle class and our country's future.\nI've spoken about the rescue of the American automobile industry in Toledo, Ohio. I've spoken about retirement security down in Florida, about leading the world again in manufacturing in the Quad Cities area, and about the tax system and the unfairness of it and how to make fair up in New Hampshire.\nToday, I will -- this is the fifth in the series of those speeches, and I want to talk about an American President's single most important responsibility -- single most important responsibility -- and that's keeping our fellow citizens safe and our nation secure, particularly at a time of such extraordinary challenge and change. The poet William Butler Yeats writing about his Ireland in the year 1916 in a poem called Easter Sunday 1916, said, \"all's changed, changed utterly; a terrible beauty has been born.\"\nThe world has utterly changed during your young life and your early adulthood. It's not the world it was in 1990 and -- even as recently as 1990. And the question is: How are we going to deal with this beautiful -- this beautiful -- change that also has with its -- fraught with so many potential difficulties.\nOn this fundamental issue, foreign policy, keeping America safe, the contrast between President Obama, his record, and Governor Romney, and his rhetoric, in my view cannot be greater.\nThree and a half years ago, when President Obama and I took office, and stepped into that Oval Office, our nation had been engaged in two wars for the better part of a decade. Al Qaeda was resurgent and Osama bin Laden was at large. Our alliances were dangerously frayed. And our economy -– the foundation of our national security -– was on the precipice of a new depression.\nPresident Obama began to act immediately. He set in motion a policy to end the war in Iraq responsibly. He set a clear strategy and an end date for the war in Afghanistan, which has been going on for close to a decade. He cut in half the number of Americans who are literally serving in harm's way. He decimated al Qaeda's senior leadership. He repaired our alliances and restored America's standing in the world and he saved our economy. He saved our economy from collapse with some very unpopular but bold decisions that have turned out to be right, including the rescue of the automobile industry, all of which has made us much stronger not only at home but abroad.\nIf you're looking for a bumper sticker to sum up how President Obama has handled what we inherited, it's pretty simple: Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive. (Applause.)\nGovernor Romney's national security policies, in our view, would return us to a past we've worked so hard to move beyond. And, in this regard, there is no difference in what Governor Romney says and what he has proposed for our economy than he has done in foreign policy. In every instance, in our view, he takes us back to the failed policies that got us into the mess that President Obama has dug us out of, and the mess that got us into this in the first place.\nGovernor Romney, I think, is counting on collective amnesia of the American people. Americans know -- American know that we can't go back to the future, back to a foreign policy that would have America go it alone -- shout to the world you're either with us or against us, lash out first and ask the hard questions later, if they get asked at all, isolate America instead of isolating our enemies, waste hundreds of billions of dollars and risk thousands of Americans' lives on a war that's unnecessary -- and see the world through a Cold War prism that is totally out of touch with the realities of the 21st century.\nOn this and everything else, President Obama, in my view, has demonstrated that he is totally in touch with our times. He has acted boldly, strengthening America's ability to contend with the new forces shaping this century and to attend to the challenges and opportunities around the world that have been neglected over the past -- or previous past eight years.\nUnder President Obama's leadership, our alliances have never been stronger. He returned Europe to its rightful place as a partner of first resort in dealing with global threats, while at the same time reclaiming America's place in Asia as an Asian Pacific power -- a region where U.S. exports are producing new jobs and driving our economic recovery. We've forged a new relationship based on mutual interest with emerging powers like China, Russia, Brazil, Turkey, South Africa -- all of which are helping advance American security.\nWe reduced our reliance on nuclear weapons, achieved major arms control agreements with Russia, and brought the world together to secure nuclear materials from getting into the hands of terrorists. We've isolated countries like Iran and North Korea whose nuclear programs threaten peace and stability. And we've taken far more terrorists off the battlefield in the last three years than in the previous eight, putting al Qaeda on a path to defeat.\nAt the same time, the President shut down secret prisons overseas, banned torture, and in doing so demonstrated that we don't have to choose between protecting our country and living our values; and, as a consequence of those decisions, enhanced the security of our own soldiers abroad and the power of our persuasion around the world.\nWe plan for conflicts in the future with a new defense strategy, supported by the entire Defense Department's senior leadership. Our military will be more agile, flexible, better able to confront aggressors and project power, with strong partnerships to share the burden and smart investments in cutting edge capabilities.\nWe proposed a budget that will fund this strategy and keep faith with our wounded warriors, our veterans and their families.\nWe led the fight to free Libya and the Libyan people from Qaddafi, using our unique military assets to clear the way for our allies, who stepped up -- stepped up -- to meet their own responsibility. And the result was something that the General and others before him sought time and time again but rarely achieved: genuine burden sharing and an end to the Qaddafi regime that had murdered so many, including hundreds of its fellow citizens.\nNow, we're ratcheting up the pressure on other brutalizers, people who brutalize their citizens, like Bashar al-Assad in Syria, while engaging the forces for change in the Arab Spring and putting America firmly on the side of freedom around the world.\nWe made the G20 a new forum for international economic coordination, recognizing again the realities of the 21st century. We opened new markets around the world for American businesses. And we've refocused our development policy on building the capacity of other nations on major global health and food security initiatives and steadily, steadily combating climate change.\nThat's the essence of our record. The question is, where does Governor Romney stand? How would he keep our citizens safe and our nation secure? In the face of the challenges we now understand are ahead of us, what would Governor Romney do?\nWell, the truth is we don't know for certain, but we know where the Governor starts. He starts with a profound -- a profound -- misunderstanding of the responsibilities of a President and the Commander-in-Chief.\nHere's what he said, and I want to quote him exactly. And I quote: \"If we want someone who has a lot of experience in foreign policy, we can simply go to the State Department.\" He went on to say, and I quote, \"But that's not how we choose a President. A President is not a foreign policy expert.\"\nIn my view, the last thing we need is a President who believes that he can subcontract our foreign policy to experts at the State Department, or for that matter, any other department or agency. Because here how it works -- I've been around for eight Presidents of the United States. I hate to admit. (Laughter.) I know I don't look that old, right? (Laughter.) But eight Presidents. That's not how it works.\nPresident Obama has built a great national security team, from Secretary of State Clinton, to CIA Director Petraeus, to Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, to the Chairman of Joint Chiefs, Dempsey. President Bush put together his own team of experts. But the bottom line is this: no matter how experienced the team, no matter how wise the advice and counsel, to use that old expression, the buck literally stops on the President's desk in the Oval Office.\nOne of the toughest -- only the toughest decisions land on that desk. And as often as not, his advisors are in disagreement -- disagreements among themselves -- all smart people, but they disagree -- seldom completely unified.\nAs I know the General has heard me say before, I cannot think of any consequential decision in the eight Presidents I've served with where the President had more than 75 percent of the facts. It never works that way. Almost every significant case, it calls for a final judgment call to be made by the President, a call that the Vice President can't make, the Secretary of State can't make, the Secretary of Defense can't make -- only the President can make.\nI know from experience. I literally get to be the last guy in the room with the President. That's our arrangement. I can give him all the advice that I have and make my case, but I walk out of the room. He sits there by himself, the President sits there by himself and has to make the decision, often -- often -- reconciling conflicting judgments that are made by very smart, honorable, informed, experienced people.\nAnd the President is all alone at that moment. It's his judgment that will determine the destiny of this country. He must make the hard calls. I'd respectfully suggest President Obama has made those hard calls with strength and steadiness.\nAnd the reason he has been able to is because he had clear goals and a clear strategy how to achieve those goals. He had a clear vision and has a clear vision for America's place in the world. He seeks all the help he can get from experts as to how to realize that vision, but ultimately he makes the decision.\nSo it seems to me, Governor Romney's fundamental thinking about the role of the President in foreign policy is fundamentally wrong. That may work -- that may work -- that kind of thinking may work for a CEO. But I assure you, it will not and cannot work for a President and it will not work for a Commander-in-Chief.\nThus far, Governor Romney has not made many foreign policy-focused decisions or pronouncements. Foreign policy has not been a focus of his campaign. Now, if you'll excuse me a point of personal privilege, given President Obama's record -- the strongest foreign policy in decades -- I can understand why the President -- why Governor Romney doesn't want to make it a focus of his campaign. But it is, these are, critical issues.\nSo how do we fairly assess the views of Governor Romney on foreign policy? What are they? I think a fair way to do this -- and obviously others may disagree with whether or not I'm being as objective as possible, I think the fair way to do this is look at the few things that we do know about Governor Romney.\nWe know Governor Romney reflexively criticizes the President's policy and almost in every case without offering any specific alternative. We know that when the Governor goes -- does venture a position, it's a safe bet that he previously took or is about to take an exactly opposite position -- (laughter) -- and an equally safe bet that he is going to end up landing in the wrong place and out of the mainstream of the thinking of Republican and Democratic foreign policy experts.\nWe know that when he agrees with the President of the United States, as he has done, he then goes on to mischaracterize our record to create what is a non-existent contrast. And most importantly, we know that the extent that Governor Romney -- to the extent he has shown any foreign policy vision, it's through the glass of a rear-view mirror.\nLook, in my view, he would take us back to a dangerous and discredited policies that would make Americans less safe and America less secure. And the best way to try to make the points I believe are honest to make is to illustrate these propositions, is to compare President Obama's record and Governor Romney's rhetoric on major foreign policy and the national security interests of our day.\nLet's start with Iraq. When President Obama ran four years ago, he promised to end the war responsibly. He gave me the honor and the responsibility of coordinating that policy. He kept this commitment. He brought home -- it was already mentioned -- all 150,000 of our troops and developed a strong relationship with a sovereign Iraq.\nLast December, Governor Romney initially applauded the withdrawal, which he went on to say -- partially, which is true -- he went on to say the credit should go to President Bush, but he applauded the decision. Three months later, he reversed him, saying, and I quote, it was an \"enormous error\" -- I can back this up -- and saying that he would have left tens of thousands of U.S. troops behind in Iraq.\nIn Afghanistan, President Obama developed a clear strategy to end the war in 2014, while building the capacity of the Afghan government, its security forces and its people. Setting a withdrawal date was the best way to get the Afghans to step up and take responsibility for their own country. Without it, we know from Iraq, it doesn't happen. If we're doing it all, why step up? So we know unless you set a date, the likelihood of stepping up and taking on the responsibility is unlikely to occur.\nFolks, as I've said in many circumstances, we cannot want peace and security in Afghanistan more than the Afghans want it. Our NATO partners, the International Security Assistance Force -- of some 50 countries -- embraced the President's strategy. And so did Governor Romney embrace the President's strategy -- at least at first. He endorsed the President's plan to transition to Afghanistan responsibility and withdraw our combat troops in 2014. Here's what he said, and I quote, \"that's the right timeline.\"\nBut two months later, he was against the President's plan, calling it and I quote, \"one of the biggest mistakes.\" And now, and I want to be completely straight about this, he seems -- I emphasize seems -- seems to want to keep American forces in Afghanistan indefinitely. Here again I want to quote him. And I quote, \"it's my desire and my political party's desire not to leave.\" I'm not sure the exact context. I'm not sure exactly what he meant. But I am sure he is going to have a responsibility to explain to the American people what he meant by that. He may have a reasonable explanation. But the American people deserve an explanation.\nWhere Governor Romney has expressed a clear and consistent point of view, he has been clearly and consistently stuck in the past -- and, in my view and the President's view, I might add, wrong.\nWhen we came to office, President Obama reset our relationship with Russia. To state the obvious, we had then and we have now important disagreements with Moscow. And we're going to continue to have disagreements with Moscow. But in the wake of the reset -- as we called it, when I was asked to go over and make that first speech on behalf of the administration over at a conference called the Wehrkunde Conference. In the wake of that reset, we've negotiated a major nuclear arms reduction treaty that has made us safer and sets an example, I might add, for the rest of the world for the possibility we can continue to reduce nuclear arms around the world.\nIn addition, President Obama convinced Russia to cancel the sale of Russia's very sophisticated S300 cutting edge, air defense radar system, to Iran. Russia joined the United States -- hadn't been until then -- joined the United States in the toughest ever sanctions against Iran, gave us permission to transit Russian territory and airspace with weapons and supplies for American troops in Afghanistan -- the only other source and now the sole source, hopefully, only temporarily.\nBut just a month ago, Governor Romney, called and here again I quote, \"without question our number one geopolitical foe\" is Russia. (Laughter.) As my brother would say, go figure. (Laughter.) And sometimes -- I don't know whether it's a slip of the tongue or it's a mindset -- but he even refers to Russians as \"Soviets\" -- (laughter) -- which I think -- no, I think reveals a mindset. Everybody sometimes slips -- I never do, but everybody sometimes slips. (Laughter and applause.)\nLook, I think it's fair to say when it comes to Russia, based on only what we know he's said so far, Governor Romney is mired in a Cold War mindset. Similarly, the Governor aggressively attacked New START, the nuclear arms control treaty that President Obama negotiated with Moscow. He attacked it. That treaty reduces a number of strategic nuclear weapons in Russia's arsenal and allows inspections of Russia's nuclear arsenals to resume without placing any constraints on U.S. missile defense and our conventional strike capabilities.\nGovernor Romney was part of a very small group of Cold War holdovers who never met an arms control treaty that he likes. He was way out of the mainstream in this issue, unless you think that's just political hyperbole. Let me tell you why. Virtually the entire Republican foreign policy establishment disagreed with him, starting with Secretary Henry Kissinger, Secretary Colin Powell, Senator Richard Lugar -- the most informed person on foreign policy in the Senate, National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley, Secretary of State Jim Baker, Secretary of State George Schulz, National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft and President George H. W. Bush, all -- all support it and strongly support it and helped us get past through some recalcitrant Republican senators this critically important treaty.\nUnfortunately, Governor Romney's apparent determination to take U.S.-Russian relations back to the '50s also causes him to misstate the facts. For example, he charged that -- as he calls it to appease Moscow -- to appease Moscow, \"President Obama has been pliant on missile defense and abandoned our missile defense sites in Poland.\"\nHere again he is either woefully misinformed or totally misunderstands. As it happens, President Obama asked me to secure allied support for a new and more effective missile defense system in Europe, the so-called Phased Adaptive Approach.\nSo the first visit I made was to Poland. And who did we ask to host these new components for this more sophisticated system? That's right, Poland, along with Turkey, Romania, Germany and Spain, who all said yes. These countries and all of NATO embraced our new approach, because they understand it will protect them more quickly and more effectively than the missile defense program Romney wanted to stick with.\nAnd I'd add parenthetically, it also provides better protection for the United States of America. As then Secretary of Defense Bob Gates, who served in Republican and Democrat administrations, said, and I quote, \"we are strengthening, not scrapping, missile defense in Europe.\"\nBut I think nothing speaks more powerfully to the differences between President Obama and Governor Romney than one of the defining moments in the past four years, the hunt for Osama bin Laden. In 2008, while campaigning for the nomination, Governor Romney was asked what he would do about bin Laden. Let me tell you exactly what he said, and I quote. He said, \"there would be very insignificant increase in safety,\" then he went to say, \"if Bin Laden was brought to justice.\" He then went on -- that's a quote. He then went on to say, \"it's not worth moving heaven and Earth, spending billions of dollars just to catch one person.\"\nHere's how candidate Obama answered that question. He said, \"if I have Osama bin Laden in our sights, I will take him out. I will kill bin Laden. We will crush al Qaeda. This has to be our biggest national security priority.\"\nI was a little bit more direct. I said, we'd follow the S.O.B. to the gates of Hell if we had to. (Laughter and applause.)\nBut here's the deal, President Obama always means what he says. He said it as a candidate, and he kept that commitment. Just a few months into office, sitting in the Oval Office, and I spend four to six hours a day with this President, that's why we've become such good friends, and I've gotten to know him so well, literally, and has -- made almost every meeting he has. We were sitting in the meeting, and he turns to Leon who was -- Panetta, who was then the chairman of -- excuse me, the head of the CIA, Director of CIA and military personnel there, and he made it clear what his priority was.\nAnd on June 2, 2009, he ordered Leon Panetta, gave the following written order, and I quote, \"in order to ensure that we have expended every effort, I direct you to provide me within 30 days a detailed operational plan for locating and bringing to justice Osama bin Laden.\" It was the President's highest priority for the CIA.\nThen, he made one of the most courageous decisions I've seen a President make and I would argue in a long time. He authorized a very, high risk mission to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, even though -- and I was one of six people who for four months or so were the only ones who knew about the possibility of his location -- even though at the end of the day, there was no better, as you know, General, than a 50/50 chance bin Laden was present in the compound.\nBut despite that reservation -- and I might add the reservations of almost every one of his -- the only full-throated support for moving when we did was from Leon Panetta, the Director of the CIA, myself included.\nPresident Obama said afterwards when he made the decision: \"This was a very difficult decision. It entailed enormous risk to the guys I sent there. But ultimately I had so much confidence in the capacity of our guys to carry out the mission that I felt the risks were outweighed by the potential benefit to us of finally getting our man.\"\nAnd I might add parenthetically, does anybody doubt had the mission failed, it would have written -- the beginning of the end of the President's term in office. This guy has got a backbone like a ramrod. No, no, for real. (Laughter.) For real.\nOn this gut issue, we know what President Obama did. We can't say for certain what Governor Romney would have done. But we can say that, unlike Governor Romney, the American people believe, and I quote, \"it was worth moving Heaven and Earth to get bin Laden.\"\nI said before thanks to President Obama, bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive. You have to ask yourself, if Governor Romney had been President, could he have used the same slogan –- in reverse? People are going to make that judgment. It's a legitimate thing to speculate on.\nLook, on a few core issues, there's no real difference between President Obama and Governor Romney. So in those cases, as I said at the outset, in my view, Governor misrepresents the President's approach or suggests that the President is not doing things that in fact he is already doing.\nAgain, let me give you some examples. Iran's nuclear program is maybe the clearest example. President Obama is determined to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. He has stated that no options are off the table, and he's been clear and concise saying that containment is not our policy.\nWhen he took office, the effort to pressure Iran was stuck in neutral, Iran's influence -- and think about this, when he took office, Iran's influence was spreading in the region. And American leadership was in doubt. I would argue we were not much respected by our friends, and not really feared by our enemies.\nBut President Obama understood that by seeking to engage Iran in the first interest, by going the extra diplomatic mile and presenting Iran a clear choice, we would demonstrate to the world that Iran, not the United States, was the problem.\nThe President's smart, tough diplomacy turned the tables on Tehran and secured the strongest unilateral and international sanctions in history; all the major powers, including Russia and China, participating.\nNow, Iran is more isolated and the international community more united in their effort to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon than ever before. Tehran has deep difficulties acquiring equipment and technology for its nuclear and missile program. It's increasingly cut off from the international financial system, unable to do the most basic business transactions.\nAnd its economy has been grievously wounded, and the worst is still to come. In June, a European embargo on imports of oil from Iran kicks in. Folks, look, as a result of this unprecedented pressure, Iran is back to the negotiating table. You can't predict what the end result will be, but they're back to the table.\nGovernor Romney has called for what he calls for a \"very different policy\" on Iran. But for the life of me, it's hard to understand what the Governor means by a very different policy. Here's what he says. He says we need \"crippling sanctions\" -- apparently unaware that through President Obama's leadership, we have produced just that –- crippling sanctions.\nHe emphasizes the need for \"a credible military option\" and a \"regular presence of aircraft carrier groups\" in the region –- apparently ignorant of the fact that's exactly what our policy is and what we're doing.\nThe only step -- I think it's fair to say -- the only step we could take that we aren't already taking is to launch a war against Iran. If that's what Governor Romney means by a very different policy, he should tell the American people. He should say so. Otherwise, the Governor's tough talk about military action is just that -- talk. And I would add counterproductive talk.\nFolks, loose talk about a war has incredible negative consequences in our efforts to end Iran's nuclear quest. And let me tell you why: Because it unsettles world oil markets. It drives up oil prices. When oil prices go up, Iran's coffers fill up, undermining the impact of the sanctions that are in existence. This kind of Romney-talk is just not smart.\nPresident Obama has said, and I quote, \"now is the time to let our increased pressure sink in, and to sustain the broad international coalition we have built. Now is the time to heed the timeless advice from Teddy Roosevelt: 'speak softly and carry a big stick.'\" I promise you the President has a big stick. (Laughter.) I promise you.\nPresident Obama understands what Governor Romney apparently doesn't: It is possible -– it's indeed necessary -– for America to be strong and smart -- and smart -- at the same time.\nLook, no country is more concerned about a nuclear Iran than Israel, and rightly so. And no President since Harry Truman has done more for Israel's security than Barack Obama.\nOur administration provided record levels of security assistance. We funded what's referred to as the Iron Dome, a missile defense system that recently intercepted in those rockets coming out of Gaza, nearly 80 percent of the rockets fired from Gaza just a few weeks ago, saving homes, schools, hospitals and the men, women and children who inhabit them.\nWe're collaborating right now and have been on longer range missile defense systems like Arrow and David's Sling, and tying Israel into our early warning radar system. The U.S. and Israel's top political, defense, and security intelligence officers are engaged in the most consistent, comprehensive consultations ever.\nYou know this better than anybody, General. Together we're conducting the largest joint military operations in the history of the relationship. And President Obama has stood up to what is I think the gravest threat to Israel, the effort of the rest of the world to delegitimize it as a state and I might add, often stood up alone -- alone -- in fighting the effort to delegitimize Israel at the United Nations and other international organizations -- single vetoes.\nIsrael's leaders have called President Obama's support for and cooperation with Israel \"unprecedented.\" Governor Romney though, said relations between the United States and Israel had \"hit a low\" and went on to accuse President Obama of -- this is a good one -- \"throwing Israel under the bus.\" That's just one in a long litany of untruths about our administration's policy toward Israel uttered by Governor Romney and repeatedly debunked by reporters, policy experts, fact checkers across the country -- and maybe most convincingly debunked by Israeli leaders.\nMaybe the Governor is simply unaware or misinformed again. Unfortunately, it's more likely in my view the Governor is falling back on one of his party's favorite tricks of late -- distort and mischaracterize your opponent's position, keep repeating the distortions and mischaracterizations over and over again even when every objective observer says you're wrong, keep repeating in the hope that it will eventually stick.\nPresident Obama has reshaped American foreign policy to contend with the challenges of the present, but also to face the threats of the future. And I believe he has done it with strength and wisdom. Governor Romney wants to take us back to a world that no longer exists, with policies that are dangerously divorced from today's realities. Looking backwards is all the more misguided, because for all the peril of our times America's promise has never, never, never been greater.\nIn the 20th century, the wealth of a nation was judged by the size of its population, the strength of its army, the abundance of its raw materials and the expanse of its landmass. In the 21st century, these measures still matter and on that measure America still prevails. But more than ever before -- you students know better than any of us -- more than ever before, the 21st century, the true wealth of a nation is to be found in its human resources, its people and their ability to imagine, to innovate, to build, to compete -- folks, by that measure, America is also uniquely blessed.\nAnd the President and I believe our job -- our job -- in government is to help provide our people, all of our people, an environment in which they can fulfill the incredible potential our younger people have.\nIf we do our job, I believe our nation will be more secure, because America's strength -- America's strength in the world depends ultimately on the strength of the American Dream here at home and in our economy. That means investing in our students, our teachers, our schools, our university. It means investing advanced research and development, attempting to catch up to the rest of the world in medicine, in science and the most modern airports, ports, bridges, roads -- all of which help increase the ability of American businesses to increase productivity and access to the world; to invest in clean, sustainable energy in cutting edge manufacturing. No one is better positioned -- no one, no nation is better positioned than the United States in all those areas.\nIt also means welcoming people from around the world, which has always been the source of new blood and new brain power throughout American history. It means rewarding hard work, demanding responsibility, insisting on accountability and creating opportunity for all our citizens. These are the investments and the commitments that will grow our economy, create new jobs, keep America strong at home and allow us to continue to be the strongest nation in the world and the leader of the world.\nAnd these investments and commitments, and the commitments that President Obama and I have made and will continue to make, I think, is what's needed for America's future. As Vice President, on behalf of our nation, I have traveled well over a half a million miles since being sworn in as Vice President, many of them to far-flung countries all around the world. And like many of you who have traveled, students and non-students here, we all have the same kind of feeling when you get home, the same just sort of intuitive feeling -- there is no country like America, there is no potential like America.\nI was asked earlier how would I best define America. I was with a group of high school students. I said one word, possibilities -- possibilities.\nI am absolutely convinced, I am more certain after having served 40 years in government than I was when I was the idealistic, young senator at age 29 -- I am more confident and convinced -- that there is no country, and we want all countries to do well, but there is no country better positioned to lead the world in the 21st century than the United States of America, but only if we stay the course we're on, with the strong, smart leadership of President Obama looking forward and not in a rear-view mirror.\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. May God bless you all and may God protect our troops.\n",

    "text": "\nHey, Delaware! (Applause.) Hello, my fellow Democrats -- (applause) -- and my favorite Democrat.\nJilly, I want you to know that Beau and Hunt and Ashley and I, we're so incredibly proud of you. We admire the way when every single, solitary young person -- and they're not all young -- walks into your classroom, you not only teach them, you give them confidence. You give me confidence. And the passion she brings to trying to ease the burden on the families of our warriors -- Jilly, they know you understand them, and that makes a gigantic difference. (Applause.)\nAnd, folks, I tell you what, it was worth the trip -- (laughter) -- to hear my wife say what I've never heard her say before -- she's always loved me. (Laughter and applause.) If that's the case, why in the heck did it take five times of asking you? And that's true. Five times. I don't know what I would have done, kiddo, had you, on that fifth time, said no. (Laughter.) I love you. You're the love of my life and the life of my love. (Applause.)\nWe've got three incredible kids. And, Beau, I want to thank you for putting my name in nomination to be Vice President of the United States. I accept. I accept. (Applause.) With great honor and pleasure, I accept. Thank you. Thank you, my fellow Democrats. (Applause.)\nAnd I say to my fellow Americans -- my fellow Americans, four years ago, a battered nation turned away from the failed policies of the past, and turned to a leader who they knew would lift our nation out of the crisis. A journey we haven't finished yet. We know we still have more to do, but today, I say to my fellow citizens, in the face of the deepest economic crisis in our lifetime, this generation of Americans have proven itself as worthy as any generation before us. (Applause.) For we possess that same grit, that same determination, that same courage that has always defined what it means to be an American, has always defined all of you.\nTogether, we're on a mission. We're on a mission to move this nation forward from doubt and downturn, to promise and prosperity. A mission I guarantee you we will complete -- a mission we will complete. (Applause.)\nFolks, tonight what I really want to do is tell you about my friend, Barack Obama. (Applause.) No one could tell it as well or as eloquently as Michelle -- as you did last night, Michelle\n-- on Monday night. (Applause.) But I know him, to state the obvious, from a different perspective. I know him, and I want to show you -- I want to show you the character of a leader who had what it took when the American people literally stood on the brink of a new depression. A leader who has what it takes to lead us over the next four years to a future as great as our people.\nI want to take you inside the White House to see the President as I see him every day -- because I don't see him in sound bites. I walk 30 paces down the hall into the Oval Office, and I see him, I watch him in action.\nFour years ago, the middle class was already losing ground. And then the bottom fell out. The financial crisis hit like a sledgehammer on all the people I grew up with. You remember the headlines. You saw some of them in the previews -- highlights: \"Highest Job Losses in 60 Years.\" Headlines -- \"Economy on the Brink.\" \"Markets Plummet Worldwide.\"\nFrom the very moment President Obama sat behind the desk Resolute in the Oval Office, he knew -- he knew he had not only to restore the confidence of the nation, but he had to restore the confidence of the whole world. (Applause.) And he also knew that one false move could bring a run on the banks, or a credit collapse, to put another several million people out of work. America and the world needed a strong President with a steady hand and with the judgment and vision to see us through.\nDay after day, night after night, I sat beside him as he made one gutsy decision after the other -- to stop the slide and reverse it. I watched him. (Applause.) I watched him stand up to intense pressure and stare down enormous challenges, the consequences of which were awesome. But most of all, I got to see firsthand what drove this man -- his profound concern for the average American.\nHe knew that no matter how tough the decisions he had to make were in that Oval Office, he knew that families all over America sitting at their kitchen tables were literally making decisions for their family that were equally as consequential.\nBarack and I, we've been through a lot together in these four years. And we learned about one another -- a lot about one another. And one of the things I learned about Barack is the enormity of his heart, and I think he learned about me the depth of my loyalty to him. (Applause.) And there's another thing that has bound us together these past four years. We had a pretty good idea what all those families, all you Americans in trouble, were going through -- in part because our own families had gone through similar struggles.\nBarack, as a young man, had to sit at the end of his mother's hospital bed and watch her fight with her insurance company at the very same time she was fighting for her life. When I was a young kid, in third grade, I remember my dad coming up the stairs in my Grandpop's house where we were living, sitting at the end of my bed and saying, Joey, I'm going to have to leave for a while, go down to Wilmington, Delaware, with Uncle Frank. There are good jobs down there, honey. In a little while I'll be able to send for you and mom and Jimmy and Val, and everything is going to be fine.\nFor the rest of our lives -- my sister and my brothers -- for the rest of our life, my dad never failed to remind us that a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. (Applause.) It's about respect. It's about your place in the community. (Applause.) It's about being able to look your child in the eye and say, honey, it's going to be okay, and mean it and know it's true. (Applause.)\nWhen Barack and I were growing up, there was an implicit understanding in America that if you took responsibility, you'd get a fair shot at a better life. And the values, the values behind that bargain were the values that had shaped both of us and many, many of you. And today, those same values are Barack's guiding star. Folks, I've watched him. He has never wavered -- he never, never backs down. (Applause.)\nHe always steps up and he always asks in every one of those critical meetings the same fundamental question: How is this going to affect the average American? How is this going to affect people's lives? (Applause.) That's what's inside this man. That's what makes him tick. That's who he is. (Applause.)\nAnd, folks, because of the decisions he's made and the incredible strength of the American people, America has turned the corner. The worst job loss since the Great Depression -- we've since created 4.5 million private sector jobs in the past 29 months. (Applause.)\nLook, folks, President Obama and Governor Romney -- they are both loving husbands, they're both devoted fathers. But let's be straight -- they bring a vastly different vision and a vastly different value set to the job. (Applause.) And tonight, although you've heard people talk about it, I want to talk about two things from a slightly different perspective, from my perspective.\nI'd like to focus on two crises and show you the character of the leadership that each man would bring to this job, because as I've said, I've had a ringside seat. The first of these, a lot has been talked about -- and God love Jennifer Granholm, wasn't she great? (Applause.) Wasn't she great? I love Jennifer. (Applause.) But the first story I want to talk to you about is the rescue of the automobile industry.\nAnd let me tell you -- from this man's ringside seat, let me tell you about how Barack Obama saved more than a million American jobs. In the first days, literally the first days that we took office, General Motors and Chrysler were literally on the verge of liquidation. If the President didn't act -- if he didn't act immediately, there wouldn't be any industry left to save.\nSo we sat hour after hour in the Oval Office. Michelle remembers how -- what he must have thought when he came back upstairs. We sat. We sat hour after hour. We listened to senators, congressmen, outside advisors, even some of our own advisors. We listened to them say some of the following things. They said, well, we shouldn't step up. The risks were too high. The outcome was too uncertain.\nAnd the President, he patiently sat there and he listened. But he didn't see it the way they did. He understood something they didn't get. And one of the reasons I love him -- he understood that this wasn't just about cars. It was about the people who built and made those cars and about the America those people built. (Applause.)\nIn those meetings, I often thought about my dad. My dad was an automobile man. He would have been one of those guys all the way down the line -- not on the factory floor, not alongside the supply chain, but one of those guys who were selling American cars to American people. I thought what this crisis would have meant for the mechanics and the secretaries and the salespeople who my dad managed for over 35 years. And I know for certain that my dad, were he here today, he'd be fighting like heck for the President, because the President fought to save the jobs of those people my dad cared so much about. (Applause.)\nLadies and gentlemen, my dad respected Barack Obama -- would have respected Barack Obama had he been around for having had the guts to stand up for the automobile industry when so many others just were prepared to walk away.\nWhen I look back now, when I look back on the President's decision, I think of another son of another automobile man -- Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney grew up in Detroit. My dad managed; his dad owned -- well, his dad ran an entire automobile company, American Motors. Yes, but I don't understand that in spite of that, he was willing to let Detroit go bankrupt. Look, no, I don't think he is a bad guy. No, no -- I don't think he is a bad guy. I'm sure he grew up loving cars as much as I did. What I don't understand -- what I don't think he understood, I don't think he understood that saving the automobile worker, saving the industry, what it meant to all of America, not just autoworkers.\nI think he saw it the Bain way. I mean it sincerely -- I think he saw it in terms of balance sheets and write-offs. Folks, the Bain way may bring your firm the highest profits, but it's not the way to lead our country from the highest office. (Applause.)\nWhen things hung in the balance -- I mean, literally hung in the balance -- the President understood this was about a lot more than the automobile industry. This was about restoring America's pride. He understood -- he understood in his gut what it would mean to leave a million people without hope or work if he didn't act. And he also knew -- he also knew, he intuitively understood the message it would have sent around the world if the United States gave up on an industry that helped put America on the map in the first place. (Applause.)\nConviction, resolve, Barack Obama -- that's what saved the automobile industry. (Applause.) Conviction, resolve, Barack Obama. (Applause.)\nLook, you heard my friend, John Kerry -- this President -- this President has shown the same resolve, the same steady hand in his role as Commander-in-Chief. Look -- which brings me to the next illustration I want to tell you about, the next crisis he had to face.\nIn 2008 -- 2008, before he was President, Barack Obama made a promise to the American people. He said, if I have -- if we have bin Laden in our sights, we will -- we will take him out. (Applause.) He went on to say, that has to be our biggest national security priority.\nLook, Barack understood that the search for bin Laden was about a lot more than taking a monstrous leader off the battlefield. It was about so much more than that. It was about righting an unspeakable wrong. It was about -- literally, it was about healing an unbearable wound -- a nearly unbearable wound in America's heart. And he also knew the message we had to send around the world: If you attack innocent Americans we will follow you to the end of the Earth. (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE: U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Most of all, President Obama had an unyielding faith in the capacity and the capability of our Special Forces -- literally the finest warriors in the history of the world -- the finest warriors in the history of the world. (Applause.)\nSo we sat -- we sat, originally, only five of us -- we sat in the Situation Room, beginning in the fall of the year before. We listened. We talked. We heard. And he listened to the risks and reservations about the raid. He asked, again, the tough questions. He listened to the doubts that were expressed. But when Admiral McRaven looked him in the eye and said, sir, we can get this job done, I was sitting next to him -- I looked at your husband, and I knew at that moment he had made his decision. And his response was decisive. He said, do it -- and justice was done. (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE: U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!\nFolks, Governor Romney didn't see things that way. When he was asked about bin Laden in 2007, here's what he said -- he said, it's not worth moving heaven and Earth, and spending billions of dollars just to catch one person.\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: But he was wrong -- he was wrong. Because if you understood that America's heart had to be healed, you would have done exactly what the President did, and you would move heaven and Earth to hunt him down and to bring him to justice. (Applause.)\nLook, four years ago -- the only thing missing at this convention this year is my mom -- four years ago my mom was still with us, sitting up in the stadium in Denver. I quoted her -- (applause) -- I quoted her, one of her favorite expressions. She used to say to all her children, she said, Joey, bravery resides in every heart and the time will come when it must be summoned.\nLadies and gentlemen, I'm here to tell you what I think you already know, but I watch it up close. Bravery resides in the heart of Barack Obama, and time and time again I witnessed him summon it. This man has courage in his soul, compassion in his heart, and a spine of steel. (Applause.)\nAnd because of all the actions he took, because of the calls he made, because of the determination of American workers and the unparalleled bravery of our Special Forces, we can now proudly say what you've heard me say the last six months: Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive. (Applause.) That's right. One man. (Applause.)\nFolks, we know we have more work to do. We know we're not there yet. But not a day has gone by in the last four years when I haven't been grateful as an American that Barack Obama is our President, because he always has the courage to make the tough decision. (Applause.)\nSpeaking of tough decisions, speaking of tough calls, last week we heard at the Republican Convention, we heard our opponents -- we heard them pledge that they, too -- they, too had the courage to make the tough calls. That's what they said. (Laughter.) But, folks, in case you didn't notice -- and I say to my fellow Americans, in case you didn't notice, they didn't have the courage to tell you what calls they'd make. They never mentioned any of that. (Laughter and applause.)\nMrs. Robinson, you watched from home, I guess, from the White House, you heard them talk so much about how they cared so much about Medicare, how much they wanted to preserve it. That's what they told you. But let's look at what they didn't tell you.\nWhat they didn't tell you is that the plan they have already put down on paper would immediately cut benefits for more than 30 million seniors already on Medicare. What they didn't tell you is the plan they're proposing would cause Medicare to go bankrupt by 2016. And what they really didn't tell you is they -- if you want to know, if you want to know -- they're not for preserving Medicare at all.\nThey're for a new plan. It's called Vouchercare.\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Look, folks, that's not courage. That's not even truthful. That's not even truthful.\nIn Tampa, they talked with great urgency about the nation's debt and the need to act, to act now. But not once, not one single time, did they tell you that they rejected every plan put forward by us, by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles Commission they referenced, or by any other respected group -- to reduce the national debt. They were not for any of them. Why? Because they're not prepared to do anything about the debt if it contained even one dollar -- I'm not exaggerating -- even one dollar, or one cent in new taxes for millionaires.\nFolks, that's not courage. And that's not fair. (Applause.)\nLook, in a sense, this can be reduced to a single notion. The two men seeking to lead this country over the next four years, as I said at the outset, have fundamentally different visions and a completely different value set.\nGovernor Romney believes in this global economy, it doesn't much matter where American companies invest and put their money, or where they create jobs. As a matter of fact, in his budget proposal -- in his tax proposal, he calls for a new tax -- it's called a territorial tax -- which the experts have looked at and they acknowledge it will create 800,000 new jobs -- all of them overseas. All of them.\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: And what I found fascinating, the most fascinating I found last week was when Governor Romney said that, as President, he would take a jobs tour. Well, with his support for outsourcing, it's going to have to be a foreign trip. (Laughter and applause.) It will.\nLook, President Obama knows that creating jobs in America, keeping jobs in America, bringing jobs back to America is what the President's job is all about. That's what Presidents do -- or at least supposed to do. (Applause.)\nFolks, Governor Romney believes it's okay to raise taxes on the middle class by $2,000 in order to pay for another -- literally another trillion-dollar tax cut for the very wealthy.\nPresident Obama knows that there's nothing decent or fair about asking people with more to do less and with less to do more.\nGovernor Romney believes -- he believes that kids -- kids like our DREAMers, those immigrant children who were brought to America's shores through no fault of their own -- he thinks they're a drag on the American economy. President Obama believes that even though these DREAMERs, those kids didn't choose to come here, they have chosen to do right by America, and it's time for us to do right by them. (Applause.)\nGovernor Romney looks at the notion of equal pay in terms of a company's bottom line. President Obama, he knows that making sure our daughters get the same pay for the same jobs as our son is every father's bottom line. (Applause.)\nLook, I kind of expected all that from them, but one thing truly perplexed me at their convention -- the thing that perplexed me most was this idea they kept talking about, about the culture of dependency. They seem to think you create a culture of dependency when you provide a bright, young, qualified kid from a working-class family a loan to get to college, or when you provide a job-training program in a new industry for a dad who lost his job because it was outsourced.\nFolks, folks, that's not how we look at it. That's not how America has ever looked at it. What he doesn't understand is all these men and women are looking for is a chance, just a chance to acquire the skills to be able to provide for their families so they can once again hold their heads high and lead independent lives with dignity. That's all they're looking for. (Applause.)\nLook -- and it literally amazes me they don't understand that. I told you at the outset, the choice is stark: Two different visions, two different value sets. But at its core, the difference is able to be reduced to a fundamental difference. You see -- you, me, most Americans, have incredible faith in the decency and hard work of the American people, and we know what has made this country. It's the American people. (Applause.)\nAs I mentioned at the outset, four years ago, we were hit hard. You saw -- you saw your retirement accounts drained, the equity in your homes vanish, jobs lost or on the line. But what did you do as Americans? What you've always done -- you didn't lose faith; you fought back. You didn't give up; you got up. (Applause.) You're the ones, the American people. You're the ones! You're the reason why we are still better positioned than any country in the world to lead the 21st century. (Applause.) You never quit on America, and you deserve a President who will never quit on you! (Applause.)\nAnd, folks, there's one more thing -- one more thing our Republican opponents are just dead wrong about: America is not in decline. America is not in decline. (Applause.)\nI've got news for Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan: Gentlemen, never, ever -- it never makes sense, it's never been a good bet to bet against the American people. (Applause.) Never.\nMy fellow Americans, America is coming back, and we're not going back. And we have no intention of downsizing the American Dream. (Applause.) It's never -- never a good bet.\nLadies and gentlemen, in a moment -- in a moment, we're going to hear from a man whose whole life is a testament to the power of that dream, and whose presidency is the best hope to secure that dream for our children.\nFor, you see -- you see, we see a future -- we really, honest to God do -- we see a future where everyone, rich and poor, does their part and has a part; a future where we depend more on clean energy from home and less on oil from abroad; a future where we're number-one in the world again in college graduation; a future where we promote the private sector, not the privileged sector -- (applause) -- and a future where women once again control their own choices, their destiny, and their own health care. (Applause.)\nAnd, ladies and gentlemen, Barack and I see a future -- it's in our DNA -- where no one -- no one is forced to live in the shadows of intolerance. (Applause.)\nFolks, we see a future where America leads not only by the power -- the example of power, but by the power of our example; where we bring our troops home from Afghanistan just as we proudly did from Iraq -- (applause) -- a future where we fulfill the only truly sacred obligation we have as a nation, the only truly sacred obligation we have is to prepare those who we send to war and care for them when they come home from war. (Applause.)\nAnd tonight -- tonight, I want to acknowledge -- I want to acknowledge, as we should every night, the incredible debt we owe to the families of those 6,473 fallen angels, and those 49,746 wounded -- thousands critically -- thousands who will need our help for the rest of their lives. Folks, we never -- we must never, ever forget their sacrifice and always keep them in our care and in our prayers. (Applause.)\nMy fellow Americans, we now find ourselves at the hinge of history. And the direction we turn is not figuratively -- is literally in your hands. It has been a truly great honor to serve you and to serve with Barack, who has always stood up with you for the past four years. I've seen him tested. I know his strength, his command, his faith, and I also know the incredible confidence he has in all of you. I know this man.\nYes, the work of recovery is not yet complete, but we are on our way. The journey of hope is not yet finished, but we are on our way. And the cause of change is not fully accomplished, but we are on our way. So I say to you tonight with absolute confidence, America's best days are ahead, and, yes, we are on our way. (Applause.)\nAnd in light -- in light of that horizon, for the values that define us, for the ideals that inspire us, there is only one choice. That choice is to move forward -- boldly forward -- and finish the job -- and reelect President Barack Obama. (Applause.)\nGod bless you all and may God protect our troops. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you.\n",

Joe, Joe, Joe!\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Folks, thank you, thank you, thank you.\nLook, guys, I just want to say one thing you already know -- this woman is everything anyone could ever hope for a senator to be. (Applause.) And besides, she's my friend. I love you. Thank you, Jeannie. Thank you.\nBilly, where are you? Where's Billy? There he is. Billy -- I always kid with Billy. If I got to be in a foxhole, I want him in it with me. (Laughter.)\nIt's good to be back. Wasn't the President incredible last night? (Applause.) Doesn't it make you proud to be an American? (Applause.)\nFolks, the President and I have become friends. I know this guy. He has courage in his soul. He has compassion in his heart, and he has a spine of steel. (Applause.) And there's not a day -- I can say this with all honesty -- there's not a day that has gone by in the last four years that I haven't been grateful -- not as a Vice President but as an American -- that this man has been our President. (Applause.)\nAnd there's a simple reason why. I was asked last night, after I spoke, offstage, why. Because this guy has the courage to make the tough calls, and almost all the calls today are tough.\nLadies and gentlemen, whether it's on education, or health care, or Medicare, ending the war in Iraq, bringing an end to the war in Afghanistan -- we need a man with a steady hand and good judgment. Folks, the President is going to level the playing field and get the middle class back in the game. (Applause.)\nIt's already started because he knows -- he knows in his gut -- not just intellectually, he knows in his gut -- and this is not hyperbole -- the middle class is what built this country and what made it great. (Applause.) He knows. And he knows something our opponents either have forgotten or never knew -- America is not in decline. (Applause.)\nAnd let me say again to our opponents, gentlemen, it's never, never, ever been a good bet to bet against the American people. (Applause.)\nI've learned about this guy what you already know. He only knows one speed. He only knows one direction: Forward. And, ladies and gentlemen, speaking of a direction of moving forward, I want to introduce a friend of mine -- and he is a friend of mine -- a guy for whom I have an enormous amount of respect for his integrity and his ability because he also has had to make, knows how to make, and has made, the tough calls for New Hampshire, and New Hampshire is much better off because of him.\nFolks, the guy I'm about to introduce has a lot in common with the man that he's going to introduce. New Hampshire is better off because of the Governor, and America is better off because of the President. (Applause.)\nLadies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to introduce to you my friend, John Lynch, and the First Lady of New Hampshire, Dr. Susan Lynch. Give it up for them. (Applause.)\n",

    "text": "\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello, Ohio! (Applause.) Hello, everybody back in the next county over there! What a great crowd! (Applause.)\nBefore I begin, I want you all to look at those two words: Vote Early. Do it now. (Applause.)\nWasn't the President great last night?\nAUDIENCE: Yes!\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Last night, we saw a Commander-in-Chief who is in command of the issues. You guys got to see what I see every day for the last four years, a President who clearly understands America's interest around the world and has the courage to pursue and protect those interests.\nLadies and gentlemen, this is a man who's not only earned my respect and all those who work with him and all of you, but he's earned the respect of all the world leaders. (Applause.) Ladies and gentlemen, the Commander-in-Chief not only knows how to lead America, but this Commander-in-Chief is leading the world. (Applause.)\nAs my dad would say, this is a man with a steady hand and a clear vision; a man who leads not only by the example of our power, but by the power of America's example. This is a President who says what he means, means what he says, and does what he says. (Applause.)\nThis is a man the world relies on, and we rely on. And, boy, was the contrast clear last night. (Applause.) Whoa! Whoa! It wasn't even close, was it?\nAUDIENCE: No!\nTHE PRESIDENT: No. (Laughter.) As the President pointed out last night, these debates have exposed that Governor Romney and Paul Ryan have a foreign policy right out of the '80s, a social policy out of the '50s, and an economic policy right out of the '20s. (Applause.) The differences in our policies and, I would submit to you, in our values, are profound, and the American people, after four debates, know it.\nLadies and gentlemen, that's why last night you saw Governor Romney rushing to agree with the President on Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria. He disavowed the foreign policy he's been running on for the past two years just like that. Even this one -- this one amazed me. (Laughter.) This one amazed me. He even tried to rewrite the history of his position on rescuing the automobile industry. Whoa! (Laughter.) If I only knew he was ready to help back then. (Laughter.) If I only knew.\nLook, half the time, I didn't know whether Governor Romney was there to debate Barack Obama or endorse Barack Obama. (Applause.) I mean, it's hard to tell.\nBut I have a message for the good governor. Governor, you can't run from the truth. You can't run from your record. You can't run from your policies.\nLook at his policies -- opposition to nuclear arms control agreements; wanting to keep 30,000 troops in Iraq; shredding regulations, which he commits to do, letting Wall Street gamble with our money again and letting banks write their own rules again; proposing over $2 trillion in new tax cuts for the wealthy while raising taxes on the middle class.\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Folks, folks, we have seen this movie before and we know how it ends. It ends in a catastrophe for the middle class. It ends in the Great Recession of 2008. And the American people are not prepared to go back -- and we're not either. (Applause.)\nFolks, this President is leveling the playing field, getting the middle class back in the game. He knows how to build America, from the middle out. That's how you build America. (Applause.) And thanks to his leadership and the grit of the American people, America is coming back.\nThere is no quit in America. There never has been any quit in America. (Applause.) The American people know only one way forward -- only one way -- and that is forward. And together -- together, ladies and gentlemen, all of us -- even the 47 percent of us that Romney doesn't think matter -- (applause) -- we're moving forward. (Applause.) Regardless.\nI've never met two guys who are more down on America. Every time they turn around, America is in decline; American people won't take responsibility. I don't know where they live. But it's not where we live. It's not who we are. (Applause.)\nAnd, ladies and gentlemen, regardless of what our opponents say, what they try to paint, America is not in decline. Americans are not dependent people. We are strong. We're independent. We take responsibility. And I've got news for Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan -- it's never, never, ever been a good bet to bet against the American people. Never. (Applause.)\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, join me in welcoming my friend, our President, Barack Obama. (Applause.)\n",

    "text": "\nThank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I love you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you, thank you, thank you. You've- – I love you. Ladies and gentlemen, eight years ago, I stood on a stage in Denver. And I accepted your nomination to be Vice President of the United States. And every single day since then is been the honor of our lives for Jill and me. Everyday, we've been grateful to Barack and Michelle for asking them to join us in this, join them in that incredible journey. [applause]\nA journey, a journey that can only happen in America. [applause]\nBut we not only have worked together, as it becomes pretty obvious, we've become friends. We're now family.\nWe're family. Folks, you've all seen over the last eight years, what President Obama means to this country. He's the embodiment – – [applause]\nHe is the embodiment of honor, resolve and character. One of the finest Presidents we have ever had. [applause]\nThat's right. [applause]\nThis is a man of character. [applause]\nAnd he's become a brother to Jill and me. And Michelle, I don't where you are kid, but you're incredible. You are incredible. [applause]\nAnd I was talking to Barack today, it's no longer who's going to give the best speech, we already know who did that. You were incredible Monday night. [applause]\nThe Delaware delegation as they say in Southern Delaware – – [applause]\nBarack and I married way up. Way up. Folks, as I stand here tonight, I see so many friends and colleagues, like my buddy Chris Dodd and the Connecticut delegation. So many people are here. I see the faces of those who have placed their belief in Barack and me. So many faces, but one.\nThis is kind of a bittersweet moment for Jill and me and our family. In 2008, when he was about to deploy to Iraq and again in 2012, our son Beau introduced me to the country and placed my name in nomination.\nYou got a glimpse, I know I sound like a Dad, but you got a glimpse of what an incredibly fine young man Beau was. [applause]\nThank you. [applause]\nThank you. [applause]\nHis wife Hallie, and his two kids are here tonight. [applause]\nBut as Ernest Hemingway once wrote, the world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong at the broken places. I've been made strong at the broken places, by my love Jill, by my heart, my son Hunter and the love of my life, my Ashley.\nAnd by all of you, and I mean this sincerely, those of you that have been through this, you know I mean what I say. By all of you, you're love, your prayers, your support, but you know what, we talk about, we think about the countless thousands of other people, who suffered so much more than we have, with so much less support.\nSo much less reason to go on. But they get up, every morning, everyday. They put one foot in front of the other. They keep going. That's the unbreakable spirit of the people of America. That's who we are. [applause]\nThat's who we are. Don't forget it. Like the people in the neighborhood that Jill and I grew up in. She in Willow Grove and mine down in Wilmington, and Claymont. The kid in Claymont with the most courage — always jumped in when you were double teamed or your back was against the wall, who became a cop, because he always wanted to help people. The middle daughter of three daughters, who always made her mother smile, who was a hero to her sisters. Now a major in the United States Marine Corps because Mr. President, I wanted to serve my country.\nThe teacher, the teachers who Jill knows, and so many of you know, who take money out of their own pockets to buy pencils and notebooks for the students who can't afford them. [applause]\nWhy? Why, because being a teacher is not what they do, it's who they are. [applause] You know what I know, for real. These are the people who are the heart and soul of this country. It's the America that I know. The America that Hillary knows and Tim Kaine knows. You know, I've known Hillary for well over 30 years, before she was First Lady of the United States, when she became First Lady. We served in the United States Senate. And during her years of Secretary of State, once a week we had breakfast in my home, the Vice President's residence.\nEverybody knows, she's smart. Everybody knows, she's tough. But I know what she's passionate about. I know Hillary. [applause]\nHillary understands. Hillary gets it. Hillary understands that college loan is about a lot more than getting a qualified student education. It's about saving the mom and dad from the indignity of having to look at their talented child and say sonny, honey, I'm so sorry. The bank wouldn't lend me the money. I can't help you to get to school. I know that about Hillary.\nHillary understood that for years, millions of people went to bed staring at the ceiling, thinking oh my God what if I get breast cancer, or he has a heart attack. I will lose everything, what will we do then? I know about Hillary Clinton.\nLadies and gentlemen, we all understand what it will mean for our daughters and granddaughters, when Hillary Clinton walks into the Oval Office as President of the United States of America. It will change their lives. [applause]\nMy daughters and granddaughters can do anything, any son or grandson can do. And she will prove it Mr. Mayor. So let me say as clearly I can, as I can, if you live in the neighborhoods like the one Jill and I grew up in. If you worry about your job and getting a decent pay, if you worry about your children's education, if you're taken care of an elderly parent. Then there's only one, only one person in this election who will help you.\nThere's only one person in this race who will be there, who has always been there for you, and that's Hillary Clinton's life story. It's not just who she is, it's her life story. She's always there. She's always been there, and so has Tim Kaine. [applause]\nLadies and gentlemen, to state the obvious and I'm not trying to be a wise guy here. I really mean it. That's not Donald Trump's story. Just listen to me a second without booing or cheering. I mean this sincerely, we should really think about this. His cynicism is unbounded.\nHis lack of empathy and compassion can be summed up in a phrase that I suspect he's most proud of having made famous, you're fired. I mean really, I'm not joking. Think about that. Think about that. Think about everything you learned as a child, no matter where you were raised. How can there be pleasure in saying, you're fired? He's trying to tell us, he cares about the middle class, give me a break. That's a bunch of malarkey. [applause]\nI tell you. [applause]\nFolks, whatever, – – [applause]\nWhatever he thinks, whatever he thinks and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. I know I'm called middle class Joe and in Washington, that's not meant as a compliment. It means you're not sophisticated. But I know why we're strong. I know why we have held together. I know why, we are united. It's because there's always been a growing middle class. This guy doesn't have a clue about the middle class, not a clue. [applause]\nBecause, folks, when the middle class does well, when the middle class does well, the rich do very well and the poor have hope. They have a way up. He has no clue about what makes America great. Actually he has no clue period. [applause]\nBut folks, let me – – you got it. [applause]\nOK. But folks, let me, let me say, let me say something that has nothing to do with politics. Let me talk about something that I am deadly serious about. This is a complicated and uncertain world we live in. The threats are too great. The times are too uncertain, to elect Donald Trump as President of the United States, now let me finish. No major party, no major party nominee in the history of this nation has ever known less has been less prepared to deal with our national security. [applause]\nWe cannot elect a man who exploits are fears of ISIS and other terrorists. Who has no plan whatsoever to make us safer. A man who embraces the tactics of our enemies, torture, religious intolerance, you all know. All the Republicans know, that's not who we are. It betrays our values. It alienates those who we need in the fight against ISIS. Donald Trump, with all his rhetoric, would literally make us less safe. We cannot elect a man, who belittles are closest allies, why embracing dictators like Vladimir Putin. No, I mean that. A man who seeks to sow division in America for his own gain, and disorder around the world. A man who confuses bluster with strength. We simply cannot let that happen as Americans, period. [applause]\nFolks – – [applause]\nI have, no one every doubts I mean what I say. It's just that sometimes they say all that I mean. But folks, let me tell you what I literally tell every world leader I've met with and I've met them all. It's never, never, never been a good bet to bet against America. [applause]\nWe have the finest fighting force in the world. Not only – – [applause]\nNot only, not only do we have the largest economy in the world, we have the strongest economy in the world. We have the most productive workers in the world. And given a fair shot, given a fair chance, Americans have never, ever, ever, ever, let their country down. Never. [applause]\nNever. Ordinary people like us who do extraordinary things – –\nWe've had candidates before attempted to get elected to appealing to our fears, but they never succeeded, because we do not scare easily. We never bow, we never bend, we never break when confronted with crisis. No, we endure, we overcome and we always, always, always move forward. [applause]\nThat's why, that's why I can say with absolute conviction, I am more optimistic about our chances today than when I was elected as a 29 year old kid to the Senate. The 21st century is going to be the American century. [applause]\nBecause we lead by not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. That is the history of the journey of America. And God willing, God willing, Hillary Clinton will write the next chapter in that journey. We are America, second to none. And we own the finish line. Don't forget it.\nGod bless you all and may God protect our troops. Come on. We're America. Thank you.\n",

    "text": "\nVice President Joe Biden announced his candidacy for President of the United States this morning and announced a multi-week rollout underscoring the core values of his campaign: reclaiming the soul of the nation; rebuilding the middle class, the backbone of America; and uniting Americans.\nMoments ago he released a video laying out the first of these pillars, Biden's belief that the core values of this nation—our standing in the world, our very democracy and everything that has made us who we are—are at stake. We are in a battle for the very soul of this nation.\nOver the coming weeks, Biden will travel to key cities and states across the country to make his case to voters and listen to the concerns of the American people.\nOn Monday, April 29, Biden will travel to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to lay out his vision for rebuilding America's middle class. The middle class has always been the greatest source of stability in our country and for far too long it has been under attack. Biden's remarks will lay out his vision for making sure when we rebuild the middle class, this time everyone - regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or disability - is in on the deal.\nAfter these remarks, Biden will travel through early voting states to hear directly from voters about their concerns and the issues affecting their everyday lives.\nOn May 18, he will hold a rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - the birthplace of our democracy. In Philadelphia, Biden will lay out his vision for unifying America with respected leadership on the world stage—and dignified leadership at home. Joe Biden will be a president who will stand up for all of us, demanding equal opportunity, equal rights, and equal justice for all.\nJoe Biden knows that when you give ordinary Americans a fighting chance, they do extraordinary things. That's the campaign we're building.\nHe believes our best days are still ahead. That's the future we're fighting for.\nAmerica is an idea. Based on a founding principle that all men are created equal.\nIt's an idea that's stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, and more powerful than any dictator.\nIt gives hope to the most desperate people on Earth. It instills in every single person in this country the belief that no matter where they start in life, there's nothing they can't achieve if they work at it.\nToday, that idea is under attack.\nWe've got a president who assigns a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it.\nA president who, like most charlatans and demagogues throughout history, seeks only to aggrandize himself, to consolidate his own power -- by blaming the \"other.\"\nIf we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation.\nI cannot stand by and watch that happen.\nOur core values, our very standing in the world, our democracy, and everything that makes us who we are is at stake.\nThat's why I'm announcing my candidacy for President of the United States.\nIt's time to get up and remember who we are.\nWe're Americans: tough, resilient, but always full of hope.\nIt's time to treat each other with dignity again. Build a middle class that works for everybody. Fight back against the incredible abuses of power we're seeing. It's time to dig deep and remember that our best days still lie ahead.\nIt's time for respected leadership on the world stage -- and dignified leadership at home. It's time for equal opportunity, equal rights, and equal justice. It's time for an economy that rewards those who do the work. It's time for a president who will stand up for all of us.\nWe haven't always lived up to our founding ideals. But we have never before walked away from them.\nI'm running to help make sure we never do.\nToday, I want to know if you're with me.\nLet's go.\n— Joe\n",

    "text": "\nCharlottesville, Virginia is home to the author of one of the great documents in human history. We know it by heart: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights.\"\nWe've heard it so often, it's almost a cliché. But it's who we are. We haven't always lived up to these ideals; Jefferson himself didn't. But we have never before walked away from them.\nCharlottesville is also home to a defining moment for this nation in the last few years.\nIt was there on August of 2017 we saw Klansmen and white supremacists and neo-Nazis come out in the open, their crazed faces illuminated by torches, veins bulging, and bearing the fangs of racism. Chanting the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the '30s. And they were met by a courageous group of Americans, and a violent clash ensued and a brave young woman lost her life.\nAnd that's when we heard the words from the president of the United States that stunned the world and shocked the conscience of this nation. He said there were \"some very fine people on both sides.\" Very fine people on both sides?\nWith those words, the president of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it. And in that moment, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I had ever seen in my lifetime.\nI wrote at the time that we're in the battle for the soul of this nation. Well, that's even more true today. We are in the battle for the soul of this nation.\nI believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time. But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation — who we are — and I cannot stand by and watch that happen.\nThe core values of this nation, our standing in the world, our very democracy, everything that has made America, America, is at stake.\nThat's why today I'm announcing my candidacy for President of the United States.\nFolks, America's an idea, an idea that's stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It gives hope to the most desperate people on earth, it guarantees that everyone is treated with dignity and gives hate no safe harbor. It instills in every person in this country the belief that no matter where you start in life, there's nothing you can't achieve if you work at it.\nThat's what we believe. And above all else, that's what's at stake in this election.\nWe can't forget what happened in Charlottesville. Even more important, we have to remember who we are.\n",

The new video also tells the story of his extraordinary commitment to fighting for everyone regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or disability.\nFrom Scranton and Wilmington to the U.S. Capitol and White House, Biden has always remembered where he comes from and the values that his parents instilled in him: treat everyone with dignity. Equal opportunity for all. Stand up to abuses of power.\nWatch: America: Anything Is Possible\nTranscript below:\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: This is an extraordinary man  with an extraordinary career in public service. Somebody who has devoted  his entire professional life  to service to this country.\nHe revitalized American manufacturing  as the head of our middle-class task force.\nHe fought to make college more affordable.\nHe suited up for our cancer moonshot, giving hope to  millions of Americans.\nJoe's candid counsel has made me a better president.\nHe led our It's On Us campaign against campus sexual assault.\nHe championed landmark legislation to protect women from violence.\nHe led our efforts to combat gun violence.\nHe could not have been a more effective partner in the progress that we've made.\nThe best part is he's nowhere close to finished.\nVICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: America is an idea. An idea that goes back to our founding. That all men are created equal.\nIt's an idea that's stronger than any army. Bigger than any ocean. More powerful than any dictator or tyrant.\nIt gives hope to the most desperate people on earth.\nIt's about decency.\nIt's about giving no room or solace to hate.\nWe are seeing appeals to populism, nationalism, and xenophobia, in a system dominated and rigged in favor of the powerful.\nEverybody, everybody, everybody is entitled to be treated with dignity.\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: He has never once forgotten the values and the moral fiber that made him who he is.\nVICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: This country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs.\nYou built this country. The great middle class built this country.\nThat's the story of America.\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: When Joe talks to autoworkers whose livelihoods he helped save,  we hear the son of a man who once knew the pain of having to tell his  kids that he had lost his job.\nWhen Joe talks about hope and opportunity for our children,  we hear the father who rode the rails home every night so he could be there to tuck his kids into bed.\nWhen Joe sticks up for the little guy, we hear the young boy who used  to stand in front the mirror reciting Yates, determined to  vanquish a debilitating stutter.\nWhen Joe talks to Gold Star families who've lost a hero we hear a kindred spirit, another father of an American veteran.\nSomebody who's been forced to wander through the darkness himself and who knows who to lean on to find the light.\nThat's Joe Biden.\nResilient, loyal, and a patriot.\nVICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I was raised, you were raised with the notion that in America anything is possible.\nIt instills in every single person in this country the belief that no matter  where they start in life, there's nothing they can't achieve  if they work at it.\nI am more optimistic about America's chances in the world today than I ever have been in my whole career.\nWe've got to stand up. We've got to get out of our own way.\nWe've got to lift our heads up. And remember who we are.\nWe are the United States of America.\nThere's not a single thing we can't do.\n",

    "text": "\n[As prepared for delivery.]\nThank you, Jill. I'm Joe Biden and I'm Jill's husband.\nJilly is a Philly girl. She loves Philly, and I do too. But to paraphrase James Joyce, when I die, Delaware will be written on my heart.\nShe made a great second lady. And she's going to make one heck of a First Lady.\nOver the past three weeks we've been all across America – Pittsburgh, Iowa, South Carolina, Nevada, California, New Hampshire – and today – Philadelphia.\nThis campaign is just getting started. And I promise you this – no one – no one – is going to work longer and campaign harder to win your trust and support than this son of Catherine Eugenia and Joseph Biden!\nSo if you want to be part of our campaign, pick up your phones now. Send the word UNITED to the number 303-30. That's the word UNITED to the number 303-30.\nSo why do we begin this journey in this place – Philadelphia? Because this was the birthplace of our democracy.\nIt was here that two of the most important documents – in the world's history – were written. In 1776, the Declaration of Independence:\n\"We hold these truths to be self-evident.\"\nThose words formed the American creed. Equality. Equity. Fairness.\nAmerica didn't live up to that promise - for most of its people, for people of color, for women.\nBut we are born of the idea that every single person in this country – no matter where you start in life – there's nothing that's beyond your capacity if you work hard enough for it.\nThen in 1787, the U.S. Constitution:\n\"We the People.\"\nThose words changed everything. Power rested in the people – not in the government. The freedom to think, to speak, to act, to criticize the government – all protected.\n\"We\" became a model for the world. In both documents, there's a singular word: \"We.\"\n\"We hold these truths to be self-evident.\"\n\"We the people.\"\nBoth were statements of common purpose, of one people, one nation.\nOur constitution didn't begin with the phrase, \"We the Democrats,\" or \"We the Republicans.\" And it certainly didn't begin with the phrase, \"We the Donors.\"\nIt began with a phrase that said we are all in this together. We need to remember that today.\nOur politics has become so mean, so petty, so personal, so negative, so partisan, so angry, and so unproductive.\nInstead of debating our opponents, we demonize them. Instead of questioning judgments, we question their motives. Instead of listening, we shout. Instead of looking for solutions, we look to score political points.\nNo more. Because our politics is pulling this country apart at the seams. Our politics traffics in division, and our President is the divider-in-chief.\nBut he's not the only one. Far from it. He is just the worst practitioner of a politics that singles out, scapegoats, and demeans. It holds up the \"other\" as the source of all our problems.\nYou hear it: \"The immigrant, the Muslim, or anyone of a different creed, color, or conviction.\" They're the problem.\nThis has been a scheme utilized by unscrupulous politicians for decades! But it comes at a cost.\nIt weakens us, distracts us, divides us. It causes us to lose credibility around the world. It picks at the wound, and it solves nothing. This is not who we are. We are better than this.\nAnd I absolutely refuse to accept the notion that this is how it has to be. In this country, we are all bound together in this great experiment of equality, opportunity, and democracy. And everyone – and I mean everyone – is in on the deal.\nThat's why we've been that beacon for the rest of the world. That's why the world has always looked to us. America is unique in all the world.\nAmerica is an idea. An idea that's stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It offers hope to \"the tired, the poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\" as the Statue of Liberty proclaims.\nAmerica guarantees everyone is treated with dignity.It gives hate no safe harbor. That's what we believe.\nAnd I believe America has always been at its best when we've been One America. One America may be a simple notion, but that doesn't make it any less profound.\nThis nation needs to come together. And it has to come together.\nWhen we started this campaign, I said I was running for three reasons. The first, to restore the soul of the nation. The second, to rebuild the backbone of the nation. And the third, to unite this nation. One America.\nSome say Democrats don't want to hear about unity. That they are angry and the angrier you are the better. That's what they are saying you have to do to win the Democratic nomination. Well, I don't believe it. I believe Democrats want to unify this nation. That's what we've always been about. Unity.\nIf the American people want a president to add to our division, to lead with a clenched fist, closed hand and a hard heart, to demonize the opponents and spew hatred, they don't need me. They already have a president who does just that.\nI am running to offer our country – Democrats, Republicans, and Independents – a different path. Not back to past that never was, but to a future that fulfills our true potential as a country.\nNow some of these same people are saying: \"Biden doesn't get it.\" \"You can't work with Republicans.\" \"That's not the way it works anymore.\"\nWell, I'm going to say something outrageous: I know how to make government work.\nNot because I have talked or tweeted about it, but because I've done it.\nI've worked across the aisle. I've worked to reach consensus. I helped make this government work before. And I can make it work again.\nTo me, our principles must never be compromised. But compromise itself is not a dirty word.\nConsensus is not a weakness – it's a necessity. It's how this government was designed to work.\nIt's what I did as Senator. It's what I did as your Vice President working with Barack Obama. And it's what I will do as your President.\nNow let me be clear. If I am elected your President, I'm going to do whatever it takes to make progress on what matters most: civil liberties, civil rights, voting rights, a woman's right to choose, national security and personal security, health care, an economy that rewards work – not just wealth, a climate change policy that will save our children, grandchildren, and this planet.\nAnd I know there are times when only a bare-knuckled fight will do. When we have to take on the Republicans to do what is right without any help from them.\nThat's what it took to pass the Affordable Care Act. That was a tough fight. And it was a big deal.\nWhich reminds me, let me stop here and say something we don't say often enough as a party or as a nation: Barack Obama is a man of extraordinary character, courage, and decency.\nHe was a president our children could look up to and did. He was a great president. I was proud to serve everyday as his Vice President, but never more proud than on the day we passed health care. Yes, health care.\nWe did what no other Administration had been able to do. And it was done without a single Republican vote. So I know how to get things done going toe to toe with the GOP.\nBut it doesn't have to be that way on every issue. Look at the Recovery Act.\nThe Recovery Act was the cornerstone of this nation's economic recovery from the depths of the greatest financial crisis short of a depression that we've ever faced. And it's a big reason we have now had nearly ten years of uninterrupted economic growth.\nWe needed to find three Republicans in the Senate to get it passed. It was my job to find them. To persuade them to vote for it. And I did. And they did. And the country is better for it.\nOne more aside, I know President Trump likes to take credit for the economy's growth and low unemployment numbers, but just look at the facts – not the alternative facts.\nPresident Trump inherited that economy from the Obama-Biden Administration. It was given to him just like he's inherited everything else in his life. And just like everything else he's been given in life, he's in the process of squandering it as well.\nLook, the Recovery Act help saved this nation from economic ruin. To get it done, we had to work with others. We had to bring a few Republicans along. And if we hadn't, we could have had another Great Depression and ruin. So working together matters.\nThe American people want their government to work, and that's not too much to ask.\nNow I know some people in DC say it can't be done. Well, let me clue them in on something: the country is sick of it.\nThey're sick of the fighting and the childish behavior. There isn't a single person in this country that could get away with it at their job.\nAnd all they want is for their president, and their senators, and their representatives to do their job.\nAnd above all to have a president – a president who measures his days by the people he brings together rather than the division he sows.\nWe know there's serious work to be done. But it's not being done by a president who wakes up at all hours of the night to wage war on Twitter.\nWhile he's lashing out at his political enemies and obsessing over his personal grievances, the rest of the world isn't waiting.\nChina isn't waiting to build 5G or to master AI or to write new rules for the internet.\nThe rest of the world hasn't given up on the Paris Climate agreement. They know it's essential for humanity.\nThe greatest challenges we face in the future will be over. Technology, intellectual property, and clean energy – a warming planet.\nThere's not a single thing that building a wall or imposing another tariff can do to address these issues. We need a 21st Century strategy for America. But every tool that Donald Trump uses is out of the past.\nWe have to get focused on the future.\nIt's the only way we're going to invest in the educational system our people need to succeed in the 21st Century. As Jill always says, any country that out-educates us will out- compete us.\nFolks, that success will come from free community college, investments in skills training and apprenticeships, continuing education allowing people to fill the jobs of the future, a stronger commitment to pre-k education, and so much more.\nWe know what works and we know what we have to do. So let's stop fighting and start fixing.\nYou all know the Affordable Care Act was a historical achievement. 20 million Americans got coverage, and over 100 million with preexisting conditions could no longer be denied coverage.\nNow, we need to go the next step. We shouldn't start over, and we certainly shouldn't tear it down.\nTo me, giving every American the right to choose a public option like Medicare is the best way to ensure everyone is covered.\nFocusing on the future is the only way we're going to be able to build a green infrastructure. Not only new and safer roads and bridges, but greener highways, ports, and airports. New water systems – so no one in this country is drinking poisoned water. There's no question we need a new electric grid that protects this nation from cyber attacks.\nWe know what we have to do. That's why I'm running.\nSo as I said, let's stop fighting and start fixing and do it together.\nAnd it's the only way we're going to deal with the existential crisis posed by climate change. There's not much time left. We need a clean energy revolution. We need to get rid of the old ways of thinking that clean energy and job creation don't go together. They do.\nAnd we need to set the most aggressive goals as soon as possible. But we have to work together to get it done. We'll never convince the climate deniers. But even now, the traditional polluters –oil and gas companies, the automobile manufactures – know that something significant has to be done.\nWhat we need is a president who's willing to lead. Who will insist on dramatic change for our children's sake.\nFolks, let me tell you something. The single most important thing we have to do to accomplish these things is defeat Donald Trump.\nAs long as Donald Trump is in the White House, none of these critical things will get done. So if you want to know what the first and most important plank in my climate proposal for America is: beat Trump.\nHere's the thing we need to remember. On everything I just discussed – from education, infrastructure, health care, climate – there is overwhelming agreement among the American people on as to what we should do.\nThe people are not divided. It's our politics.\nAnd that gap – that failure to act – is giving rise to the worst elements in our society.\nIf you had asked me just a few years ago if American democracy was at risk, I would have laughed. No more.\nThe threat to this nation – to our democracy – is real.\nWe have watched this president now for three years. Look at what he's doing: instilling fear, sowing division, stoking racial division, undercutting every institution designed to be a check on the abuse of power. All of this in order to solidify his base and expand his power.\nThink about it. These relentless attacks on the free press – \"fake news,\" \"the enemy of the people\" – are nothing to be dismissed.\nTyrants and dictators all over the world are using Trump's language to stifle dissent and solidify their own power.\nHis attack on the independence of our courts – saying you can't trust a judge because of his Mexican ancestry. His attack on a co-equal branch of government – the Congress – blocking their ability to fulfill their Constitutional duty, their legitimate oversight. Placing himself above the law.\nWithout a whimper from Republicans in Congress who know better, these things are corrosive, threaten the core values of this nation, and undermine our standing in the world.\nEverything that has made America – America – is at risk.\nLet me ask you. Are we a nation that believes there's moral equivalence between white supremacists, neo-Nazis, KKK, and those with the courage to stand against them?\nWe don't. Trump does.\nAre we a nation that believes in ripping children from the arms of their parents at the border?\nWe don't. Trump does.\nAre we a nation that embraces dictators and tyrants like Putin and Kim Jung Un?\nWe don't. Trump does.\nEvery day we are being reminded that this election is about: who we are, what we stand for, what we believe.\nAnd everyday we are being reminded there is nothing guaranteed about our democracy. We have to fight for it. Defend it. Earn it.\nWe stand here today 140 miles from Gettysburg, perhaps the most famous symbol we have in our nation's history of the cost of division.\nIn his Gettysburg address, Lincoln didn't only honor the bravery of those who had lost their lives. He had a message for the living:\n\"It is for us to be dedicated to the great task remaining before us… that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\"\nThat wasn't just a challenge from Lincoln to those present there that day. It was a challenge Lincoln handed down to every generation of Americans to follow.\nNow that challenge has been handed to us. And it is this test above all others that future generations of Americans will measure us by:\nWill we be the ones that let government of, by, and for the people perish from the face of the earth? Will we let that happen? Dare we let that happen?\nNo. I will not. We will not.\nThe promise of this nation – our standing as a beacon of hope to the world – will not be extinguished on my watch.\nHere's the amazing thing about this moment in history.\nOn the one hand we are facing the biggest threat to who we are and what we believe that we've seen in our lifetimes.\nBut on the other hand, our future has never been more promising.\nI've said it many times. I'm more optimistic about America's future today than I was when I got elected to the United States Senate as a 29-year old.\nAnd here's why: We're better positioned than any nation in the world to lead the 21st Century.\nOur workers are three times as productive as they are in Asia. We have the biggest economy in the world. We have the strongest military in the history of the world. We have the most innovative entrepreneurs. We are virtually energy independent. We have more great research universities than the rest of the world combined.\nNo other nation in the world can match us.\nWe lead by the power of our example, not the example of our power. The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself.\nEveryone knows who Donald Trump is. We have to let them know who we are.\nWe choose hope over fear. Truth over lies. And yes – unity over division.\nIt's time for us to lift up our heads and our hearts and remember who we are. We are the United States of America. One America.\nAnd there's not a single thing we can't do if we do it together.\nGod bless all of you.\nMay God protect our troops.\n",

It was here that two of the most important documents in the world's history were written.\n\"In 1776, the Declaration of Independence: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident.' Those words formed the American creed. Equality. Equity. Fairness.

That they are angry– and the angrier you are – the better. That's what they are saying to have to do to win the Democratic nomination. Well, I don't believe it. I believe Democrats want to unify this nation. That's what we've always been about. Unity.\n\"If the American people want a president to add to our division, to lead with a clenched fist, closed hand and a hard heart, to demonize the opponents and spew hatred -- they don't need me. They already have a President who does just that. I am running to offer our country – Democrats, Republicans and Independents – a different path.\"\n",

    "text": "\nThis morning, Biden for President released new data on its robust digital fundraising operation, the first data reveal since the campaign reported it raised more than any other Democratic 2020 presidential campaign in its first 24 hours.

    "text": "\nHOUSTON, TEXAS – Today, Vice President Joe Biden announced his plan to provide public educators the support and respect they need and deserve while investing in all children from birth, so that regardless of zip code, parents' income, race, or disability all students are prepared to succeed in tomorrow's economy. Biden outlined these principles today during a town hall in Houston, Texas held together with the American Federation of Teachers, and detailed how a Biden White House would turn these goals into a reality for America's educators and students.\n\"As my wife Jill says, an educator's profession isn't just what they do, it is who they are,\" said Vice President Joe Biden. \"They answer a call to service. They help our children learn and grow into successful adults. For so many young people, knowing they have a teacher believing in and fighting for them can make all the difference. It's past time we treat and compensate our educators as the professionals they are, and that we make a commitment that no child's future will be determined by zip code, parents' income, race, or disability.\"\nFor more on Vice President Biden's plan, please see the fact sheet below.\nFACT SHEET: THE BIDEN PLAN FOR EDUCATORS, STUDENTS, AND OUR FUTURE\nToday at a forum with teachers in Houston, Texas, Vice President Biden outlined a plan that 1) provides public educators the support and respect they need and deserve, and 2) invests in all children from birth, so that regardless of their zip code, parents' income, race, or disability, they are prepared to succeed in tomorrow's economy.\nAs president, Biden will:\n\nSupport our public educators by giving them the pay and dignity they deserve.\nInvest in resources for our schools so students grow into physically and emotionally healthy adults, and educators can focus on teaching.\nEnsure that no child's future is determined by their zip code, parents' income, race, or disability.\nProvide every middle and high school student a path to a successful career.\nStart investing in our children at birth.\n\nPROVIDING EDUCATORS THE SUPPORT AND RESPECT THEY NEED AND DESERVE\nEducators deserve a partner in the White House. With President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden, they'll get two. Dr. Biden has worked as an educator for more than 30 years. She and Joe understand that, for educators, their profession isn't just what they do; it is who they are.\nEducators – teachers, teachers' aides, and everyone who supports our kids at school, from the bus drivers to the secretaries to the school nurses – answer a call to service. They help our children learn and grow into successful adults. For so many young people, knowing they have a teacher and school community believing in and fighting for them can make all the difference.\nBut while educating is rewarding, it is also challenging. Many educators across the country are experiencing stagnant wages, slashed benefits, growing class sizes, and fewer resources for their students. Too many teachers have to work second jobs to make ends meet for their families. And, far too often, teachers and school personnel have to take on additional responsibilities that go far beyond the classroom. Educators end up spending their own money on school supplies, mentoring and coaching new teachers, trying to fill in as social workers, and so much more. Teachers should be supported with resources and shouldn't have to take on all of these responsibilities on their own.\nOver the last year we have witnessed educators around the country – in states from West Virginia to Arizona to Kentucky – heroically organize walk-outs and other actions to stand up not just for their own wages and benefits, but also for the resources they need to serve their students. Educators shouldn't have to fight so hard for resources and respect.\nPresident Biden will support our public educators by giving them the pay and dignity they deserve.\n\nMake sure teachers receive a competitive wage and benefits. In 2018, public school teachers made 21.4 percent less than workers with similar education and experience. And public school teachers' average weekly wage hasn't increased since 1996. Teachers and school personnel do some of the most important and hardest work, but too often they aren't rewarded. As President, Biden will correct this wrong. Biden will triple funding for Title I, the federal program funding schools with a high percentage of students from low-income families, and require districts to use these funds to offer educators competitive salaries and make other critical investments prior to directing the funds to other purposes. Dramatically increase Title I funding in order to give teachers a raise will allow school districts and educators to decide what the biggest need is for their communities instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach. And, it will ensure that states which have been treating their teachers fairly but still have unmet needs for Title I schools can benefit from these funds.\nInvest in teacher mentoring, leadership, and additional education. We need more opportunities for highly effective teachers to remain in the classroom and advance in their careers. The Biden Administration will help school districts create opportunities for teachers to lead beyond the classroom. Teachers will be able to serve as mentors and coaches to other teachers and as leaders of professional learning communities, and will be compensated for that additional work they take on. These funds will also be used to help teachers who choose to earn an additional certification in a high-demand area – like special education or bilingual education – while they are still teaching do so without accumulating debt.\nHelp teachers and other educators pay off their student loans. Teachers shouldn't have to worry about how they are going to make their student loan payments while they are busy educating the next generation. Biden will see to it that the existing Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program is fixed, simplified, and actually helps teachers.\n\nPresident Biden will invest in resources for our public schools so students grow into physically and emotionally healthy adults, and educators can focus on teaching.\n\nDouble the number of psychologists, guidance counselors, nurses, social workers, and other health professionals in our schools so our kids get the mental health care they need. One in five children in the U.S. experience mental health problems. Yet, too many of our children are not getting the mental health care they need from a trained professional. We need mental health professionals in our schools to help provide quality mental health care, but we don't have nearly enough. The current school psychologist to student ratio in this country is roughly 1,400 to 1, while experts say it should be at most 700 to 1. That's a gap of about 35,000 to 60,000 school psychologists. Teachers too often end up having to fill the gap, taking away from their time focusing on teaching. President Biden will make an unprecedented investment in school mental health professionals in order to double the number of psychologists, guidance counselors, nurses, social workers, and other health professionals employed in our schools, and partner with colleges to expand the pipeline of these professionals.\nBring needed support for students and parents into our public schools. When parents are working hard to make ends meet, it can be difficult if not impossible for them to navigate various family needs like after-school care, health and social services, and adult education courses. When students are habitually sick because they don't have access to preventive care, or can't see the board at the front of the room because they haven't been to the eye doctor, learning becomes exponentially more difficult. But in many neighborhoods, educators, parents, and community members have come up with a solution: community schools. Community schools work with families, students, teachers and community organizations to identify families' unmet needs and then develop a plan to leverage community resources to address these needs in the school building, turning schools into community hubs. Biden will expand this model, providing this wraparound support for an additional 300,000 students and their families.\nMake sure teachers and students can work and learn in safe and healthy environments. Public school facilities received a grade of D+ from the American Society of Civil Engineer. In fact, each year the U.S. underfunds school infrastructure by $46 billion, resulting in thousands of schools that are outdated, unsafe, unfit, and – in some cases – making kids and educators sick. President Biden will include in federal infrastructure legislation funding specifically for improving public school buildings. First and foremost, these funds will be used to address health risks. Additional funds will be used to build cutting-edge, energy-efficient, innovative schools with technology and labs to prepare our students for the jobs of the future.\nDefeat the National Rifle Association – again – in order to make our schools safer. Parents shouldn't have to worry about whether their kids will come home from school, and students shouldn't have to sacrifice themselves for their friends days before graduation. We cannot let gun violence become an acceptable part of American life. Biden knows that arming teachers isn't the answer; instead, we need rational gun laws. As President, he will secure passage of gun legislation to make our students safer, and he knows he can do it because he's defeated the National Rifle Association twice before. He'll begin by again championing legislation to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines – bans he authored in 1994. In the months ahead, he will release additional proposals to address the gun violence epidemic in our country.\n\nINVESTING IN ALL CHILDREN FROM BIRTH, SO THAT REGARDLESS OF THEIR ZIP CODE, PARENTS' INCOME, RACE, OR DISABILITY, THEY ARE PREPARED TO SUCCEED IN TOMORROW'S ECONOMY\nAs Dr. Biden says, any country that out-educates us will out-compete us. In order to maintain our competitiveness, our current system of kindergarten through 12th grade education is essential but no longer sufficient. Roughly 6 out of 10 jobs in the United States require education beyond a high school diploma. And, too many parents don't have access to the resources and support they need to support and ensure their children are developing healthily. As a result, there's an achievement gap in this country before our children even enter kindergarten.\nAs President, Biden will build a public education system that starts investing in our children at birth and helps every student get some education beyond a high school diploma, whether a certification, associate's degree, or bachelor's degree. Systemic racism is persistent across our institutions today – including in our schools – and must be addressed. President Biden will make sure that no child's education opportunity is determined by their zip code, parents' income, race, or disability.\nPresident Biden will ensure that no child's future is determined by their zip code, parents' income, race, or disability.\n\nInvest in our schools to eliminate the funding gap between white and non-white districts, and rich and poor districts. There's an estimated $23 billion annual funding gap between white and non-white school districts today, and gaps persist between high- and low-income districts as well. Biden will work to close this gap by nearly tripling Title I funding, which goes to schools serving a high number of children from low-income families. This new funding will first be used to ensure teachers at Title I schools are paid competitively, three- and four-year olds have access to pre-school, and districts provide access to rigorous coursework across all their schools, not just a few. Once these conditions are met, districts will have the flexibility to use these funds to meet other local priorities. States without a sufficient and equitable finance system will be required to match a share of federal funds.\nImprove teacher diversity. Research shows us the substantial and unique impact that teachers of color have on students of color. For example, for black students, having just one black teacher in elementary school reduces the probability of dropping out. Biden will support more innovative approaches to recruiting teachers of color, including supporting high school students in accessing dual-enrollment classes that give them an edge in teacher preparation programs, helping paraprofessionals work towards their teaching certificate, and working with historically black colleges and universities and other minority-serving institutions to recruit and prepare teachers.\nBuild the best, most innovative schools in the country in low-income communities and communities of color. Preparing our students for the workforce increasingly entails not only rigorous academics, but also problem-solving, collaboration, and technical skills. Biden will create a new competitive program challenging local communities to reinvent high school to meet these changing demands of work. This funding will be targeted first toward building the best schools in the country in low-income communities and communities of color.\nReinstate the Obama-Biden Administration's actions to diversify our schools. As President, Biden will reinstate Department of Education guidance that supported schools in legally pursuing desegregation strategies and recognized institutions of higher education's interests in creating diverse student bodies. And, he will provide grants to school districts to create plans and implement strategies to diversify their schools.\nMake sure children with disabilities have the support to succeed. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, signed into law in 1990, promised to provide 40% of the extra cost of special education required by the bill. Currently, the federal government only covers roughly 14% of this cost, failing to live up to our commitment. The Biden Administration will fully fund this obligation within ten years. We must ensure that children with disabilities get the education and training they need to succeed.\n\nPresident Biden will provide every middle and high school student a path to a successful career.\n\nEnsure middle and high schools prepare students for good jobs. Students who participate in high-quality career and technical education are more likely to graduate, earn industry credentials, enroll in college, and have higher rates of employment and higher earnings. Like the arts and music, vocational training can often engage students in school, encourage pride for creativity and making, and teach entrepreneurial skills. Yet, American high schools have largely given up on \"shop classes\" in order to meet measures of accountability. The Biden Administration will invest in school vocational training and partnerships between high schools, community colleges, and employers. These partnerships will create programs that allow students to earn an industry credential upon high school graduation, a credential that readies them for a good-paying career. Career and technical education can also be used to increase access to middle- and high- school courses in computer science so that students learn computational thinking and are prepared to lead in fields such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence.\nCreate more opportunities for high school students to take practical classes that lead to credentials. Biden will invest in and allow Pell grants to be used for dual enrollment programs, so high school students can take classes at a community college and earn college credits or a credential prior to graduating from high school.\n\nPresident Biden will start investing in our children at birth.\n\nProvide high-quality, universal pre-kindergarten for all three- and four -year-olds. For families with young children, finding highly quality pre-K is a major financial, logistical, and emotional burden, with potentially life-long consequences for their children. As President, Biden will work with states to offer pre-K for all three- and four-year-olds. This investment will ease the burden on our families, help close the achievement gap, promote the labor participation of parents who want to work, and lift our critical early childhood education workforce out of poverty.\nProvide early childhood development support to families where they are most likely to access it – the pediatrician's office. For many families with young children, the pediatrician's office is the one place where they interact with service providers before their child enters school. President Biden will provide funds to ensure that there is an early childhood development expert in every community health center. He will also provide grants to help cities place early childhood development experts in other pediatrician offices with a high percentage of Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program patients. These experts, as part of the primary care team, will help identify whether children are reaching development milestones, help connect families to additional services like home visiting when needed, and answer parents' questions regarding child development so every child in the U.S. is placed on the path to succeed once they start kindergarten.\nExpand home visiting. Through the Affordable Care Act, President Obama and Vice President Biden funded voluntary home visiting programs, under which health and child development specialists make consistent, scheduled visits to help parents through the critical early stage of parenting. Families may receive coaching on preventive health and prenatal practices, learn how to care for their babies and about important child development milestones and behaviors, receive breastfeeding support, get connected to employment and child care, and receive general support in navigating the often-stressful early stages of parenthood. Home visiting has been found to improve school readiness, maternal, and child health, and reduce child maltreatment. President Biden will double funding for home visiting so more families benefit from this program every year.\n\n",

The Congressman shares Vice President Biden's vision for America: an inclusive country where hard work pays off, responsibility is rewarded, and every American can have a fair shot at success. He will be a remarkable asset as we continue to build a strong and effective grassroots movement on the ground,\" said Kamau Marshall, Biden for President Director of Strategic Communications.\nRichmond currently sits on the House Committee on the Judiciary – a panel that has seen its profile heightened as House Democrats embrace an ambitious oversight and legislative agenda. Additionally, he has been enlisted as a leader on all issues related to cybersecurity on the House Committee on Homeland Security.\n\"I'm proud to stand alongside a leader like Vice President Biden and his record of accomplishments, which includes helping rebuild the economy after the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. His track record restoring dignity to middle-class families and strengthening economic security is clear. Additionally, his experience expanding manufacturing, investing in education, and ensuring that Americans have access to affordable health care demonstrates that he understands the difficult challenges people across this nation face today,\" said Rep. Richmond.\n",

    "text": "\nToday, Vice President Joe Biden announced his bold plan to address the climate emergency impacting our planet and revitalize America's economy. The Biden Plan for a Clean Energy Revolution & Environmental Justice, summarized below, is an ambitious proposal that details how a Biden Administration will tackle the moral and economic imperative of climate change on day one.\n\"More severe storms and droughts, rising sea levels, warming temperatures, shrinking snow cover and ice sheets – it's already happening. We must take drastic action now to address the climate disaster facing the nation and our world,\" said Vice President Joe Biden. \"Science tells us that how we act or fail to act in the next 12 years will determine the very livability of our planet. That's why I'm calling for a Clean Energy Revolution to confront this crisis and do what America does best – solve big problems with big ideas.\"\nFor more on Vice President Biden's plan, please see an overview below.\nThe Biden Plan for a Clean Energy Revolution & Environmental Justice\nAddressing the global threat of climate change and revitalizing America's economy\nFrom coastal towns to rural farms to urban centers, climate change poses an existential threat – not just to our environment, but to our health, our communities, our national security, and our economic well-being. It also damages our communities with storms that wreak havoc on our towns and cities and our homes and schools. It puts our national security at risk by leading to regional instability that will require U.S military-supported relief activities and could make areas more vulnerable to terrorist activities.\nVice President Biden knows there is no greater challenge facing our country and our world. Today, he is outlining a bold plan – a Clean Energy Revolution – to address this grave threat and lead the world in addressing the climate emergency.\nBiden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face. It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2) our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected.\nIf we can harness all of our energy and talents, and unmatchable American innovation, we can turn this threat into an opportunity to revitalize the U.S. energy sector and boost growth economy-wide. We can create new industries that reinvigorate our manufacturing and create high-quality, middle-class jobs in cities and towns across the United States. We can lead America to become the world's clean energy superpower. We can export our clean-energy technology across the globe and create high-quality, middle-class jobs here at home. Getting to a 100% clean energy economy is not only an obligation, it's an opportunity. We should fully adopt a clean energy future, not just for all of us today, but for our children and grandchildren, so their tomorrow is healthier, safer, and more just.\nAs president, Biden will lead the world to address the climate emergency and lead through the power of example, by ensuring the U.S. achieves a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions no later than 2050.\nThe Biden Plan will:\n\nEnsure the U.S. achieves a 100% clean energy economy and reaches net-zero emissions no later than 2050. On day one, Biden will sign a series of new executive orders with unprecedented reach that go well beyond the Obama-Biden Administration platform and put us on the right track. And, he will demand that Congress enacts legislation in the first year of his presidency that: 1) establishes an enforcement mechanism that includes milestone targets no later than the end of his first term in 2025, 2) makes a historic investment in clean energy and climate research and innovation, 3) incentivizes the rapid deployment of clean energy innovations across the economy, especially in communities most impacted by climate change.\nBuild a stronger, more resilient nation. On day one, Biden will make smart infrastructure investments to rebuild the nation and to ensure that our buildings, water, transportation, and energy infrastructure can withstand the impacts of climate change. Every dollar spent toward rebuilding our roads, bridges, buildings, the electric grid, and our water infrastructure will be used to prevent, reduce, and withstand a changing climate. As President, Biden will use the convening power of government to boost climate resilience efforts by developing regional climate resilience plans, in partnership with local universities and national labs, for local access to the most relevant science, data, information, tools, and training.\nRally the rest of the world to meet the threat of climate change. Climate change is a global challenge that requires decisive action from every country around the world. Joe Biden knows how to stand with America's allies, stand up to adversaries, and level with any world leader about what must be done. He will not only recommit the United States to the Paris Agreement on climate change – he will go much further than that. He will lead an effort to get every major country to ramp up the ambition of their domestic climate targets. He will make sure those commitments are transparent and enforceable, and stop countries from cheating by using America's economic leverage and power of example. He will fully integrate climate change into our foreign policy and national security strategies, as well as our approach to trade.\nStand up to the abuse of power by polluters who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities. Vulnerable communities are disproportionately impacted by the climate emergency and pollution. The Biden Administration will take action against fossil fuel companies and other polluters who put profit over people and knowingly harm our environment and poison our communities' air, land, and water, or conceal information regarding potential environmental and health risks. The Biden plan will ensure that communities across the country from Flint, Michigan to Harlan, Kentucky to the New Hampshire Seacoast have access to clean, safe drinking water. And he'll make sure the development of solutions is an inclusive, community-driven process.\nFulfill our obligation to workers and communities who powered our industrial revolution and subsequent decades of economic growth. This is support they've earned for fueling our country's industrial revolution and decades of economic growth. We're not going to leave any workers or communities behind.\n\nAnd, Vice President Biden has committed that Biden for President will not accept contributions from the oil, gas and coal corporations or executives.\nThe Biden plan will make a historic investment in our clean energy future and environmental justice, paid for by rolling back the Trump tax incentives that enrich corporations at the expense of American jobs and the environment. Biden's climate and environmental justice proposal will make a federal investment of $1.7 trillion over the next ten years, leveraging additional private sector and state and local investments to total to more than $5 trillion. President Trump's tax cut led to trillions in stock buybacks and created new incentives to shift profits abroad. Joe Biden believes we should instead invest in a Clean Energy Revolution that creates jobs here at home.\nAnd, Vice President Biden has committed that Biden for President will not accept contributions from the oil, gas and coal corporations or executives.\nThe Biden plan will be paid for by reversing the excesses of the Trump tax cuts for corporations, reducing incentives for tax havens, evasion, and outsourcing, ensuring corporations pay their fair share, closing other loopholes in our tax code that reward work not wealth, and ending subsidies for fossil fuels.\nThis all builds on Vice President Biden's years of leadership on climate change – from introducing one of the first climate bills in the Senate to overseeing the largest clean energy investment in our country's history, the Recovery Act and to mobilizing the world to achieve the Paris Climate Accord..\n",

Vice President Biden returns to Iowa today and tomorrow for his second two-day swing through the state after holding events in Iowa during his first week as a candidate last month. The campaign expects to announce additional Iowa endorsements in the coming weeks.\n\"Today's endorsements are invaluable additions to the robust campaign Vice President Biden is building in Iowa,\" said Jake Braun, Iowa State Director, Biden for President. \"These are influential political and community leaders, all of whom are ready to work by Joe Biden's side to change the course of this country – fighting for the soul of our nation, rebuilding an inclusive middle class, and unifying America.\"\nToday's new endorsements include:\n\nBetty Brim-Hunter, Former Political Director, Iowa Federation of Labor\nTeri Hawks Goodman, Community Leader\nBruce Hunter, State Representative\nJim Lykam, State Senator\nMary Maloney, Polk County Treasurer\nJackie Norris, President & CEO, Goodwill of Central Iowa; Former Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff to First Lady Michelle Obama\nTom Powers, Former Councilman, City of Waterloo\nKen Runde, Former Dubuque County Sheriff & Obama Administration United States Marshal\n\nOver the last two weeks, Vice President Biden has unveiled his first two major policy proposals, both of which will be key priorities in a Biden White House.

    "text": "\n[As prepared for delivery.]\nLadies and Gentlemen, political wisdom holds that the American public doesn't vote on foreign policy – but that's an old way of thinking.\nIn 2019, foreign policy is domestic policy, and domestic policy is foreign policy.\nThey are a deeply connected set of choices we make about how to advance the American way of life and our vision for the future.\nAnd, like everything about this election, the threat Donald Trump poses to our national security, and to who we are as a country, is so extreme, we cannot afford to ignore it.\nHis erratic policies and failures to uphold basic democratic principles have muddied our reputation, our place in the world, and our ability to lead it.\nSo let me start today, by reminding everyone about what's been lost amid the chest-thumping, the self-inflicted setbacks, and the manufactured crises of this administration.\nAmerican foreign policy must be purposeful and inspiring, based on clear goals and driven by sound strategies – not Twitter-tantrums.\nAnd the overarching purpose of our foreign policy must be to defend and advance the security, prosperity, and democratic values of the United States.\nEvery President in modern history prior to Donald Trump, Democrat and Republican alike, has understood and carried out this basic directive – often imperfectly – but never before has it been so thoroughly abandoned.\nI knew when I saw how Donald Trump responded to the events in Charlottesville – assigning a moral equivalence between those who promote hate, and those who oppose it – that the threat to our democracy was unlike any in my lifetime.\nLess than a year later, Trump again stood before the press – this time on foreign soil, in Helsinki – and repeatedly deferred to Vladimir Putin – over American interests, the American intelligence community, and, I would argue, the American people. It was one of the weakest, most shameful performances by a U.S. president in modern history – perhaps ever.\nAnd one we saw repeated just last month at the G-20 summit, where Trump smirked along with Putin – making a joke out of Russia's very real, very dangerous assault on our institutions.\nTrump debases our cherished democratic values every time he plays sycophant to strongmen. When he refuses to condemn Saudi Arabia for the gruesome murder of a journalist and American resident. Or when he \"falls in love\" with a murderous dictator in North Korea.\nHe undermines our democratic alliances, while embracing dictators who appeal to his vanity. And make no mistake, the world sees Trump clearly for what he is – Corrupt, insecure, ill-informed, impulsive.\nDangerously incompetent and incapable of leadership.\nIt's why we've seen such a precarious drop in how the rest of the world views the United States.\nOne recent poll found America's leadership is now less respected than China's and on par with Russia.\nIf we give Donald Trump four more years – we may never recover America's standing in the world or our capacity to bring nations together.\nAnd that would be catastrophic for our security and our future.\nWe can't let that happen. As President, I will remind the world who we are. The United States of America does not coddle dictators. The United States of America gives hate no safe harbor.\nThere will be no more Charlottesvilles. No more Helsinkis.\nThe challenge of following this disastrous presidency, however, will not be to just restore our reputation and credibility.\nWe must enact a forward-looking foreign policy for the world as we find it today – and as we anticipate it will be tomorrow.\nMuch has shifted in the past few years. The international landscape is more crowded, competitive and complicated.\nAnd when we look at what's different today, two key points stand out, one is that the speed and intensity of our gravest challenges means that the fates of nations are more intertwined than ever before.\nClimate change, nuclear proliferation, great power aggression, transnational terrorism, cyberwarfare, disruptive new technologies, mass migration – none of them can be resolved by the United States, or any nation, acting alone.\nAmerica's security, prosperity and way of life require the strongest possible network of partners and allies working alongside us.\nYet Donald Trump's brand of America First has too often left America alone, making it that much harder to mobilize others to address threats to our common well-being.\nThe second is the rapid advance of authoritarianism, nationalism, and illiberal tendencies around the world – not just in Russia and China, but also among our allies, places like Turkey, the Philippines, Hungary.\nIn every part of the world, technology and instant information are driving change at an unprecedented pace and scope, causing many to feel confused and vulnerable.\nDemocratic governments – paralyzed by hyper-partisanship, hobbled by corruption – are having a harder time delivering for their people.\nTrust in our institutions is down. Fear of the \"other\" is up.\nTogether, these forces have driven a dangerous resurgence of extreme nationalism and illiberalism, of protectionism and xenophobia.\nAnd Donald Trump and demagogues around the world are leaning into these forces for their own personal and political gain.\nBut this is not a moment for fear.\nThis is the time for us to tap the strength and the audacity that took us to victory in two world wars and brought down the Iron Curtain.\nThat triumph of democracy and liberalism over fascism and autocracy is what created the Free World.\nAnd this contest won't just define our past – It will define our future as well.\nToday, democracy is under more pressure than at any time since the 1930s.\nFreedom House has reported that, of the 41 countries consistently ranked \"free\" from 1985 to 2005, 22 have registered net declines in freedom in the last five years.\nYet, when the world's democracies look to America to stand for the values that unite us – to truly lead the Free World – Donald Trump seems to be on the other team.\nWhen those living under oppression, yearning for freedom, look to the United States for hope – Trump has nothing to offer.\nWe cannot forget that democracy is the root of our society, the wellspring of our power,\nthe source of our renewal.\nIt strengthens and amplifies our leadership to keep us safe in the world. It's the engine of our ingenuity that drives our economic prosperity.\nIt's the heart of who we are and how we see the world – and how the world sees us.\nAs president, I will ensure that democracy is once more the watchword of U.S. foreign policy – not to launch some moral crusade, but because it is in our enlightened self-interest.\nWe must restore our ability to rally the Free World – so we can once more make our stand upon new fields of action and together face new challenges.\nWe only have one opportunity to reset our democracy. After Trump, we have to be prepared to make the most of it.\nSo, what does that mean in practice?\nFirst, it means repairing and reinvigorating our own democracy, even as we strengthen the coalition of democracies that stand with us on every continent.\nI will start by putting our own house in order – remaking our education system so that a child's opportunity in life isn't determined by their zip code or race; reforming our criminal justice system to eliminate inequitable disparities; putting the teeth back in the Voting Rights Act.\nI will seek greater transparency in our Campaign Finance System. We need to get big money out altogether, and ensure that foreign dark money doesn't continue to pollute our politics.\nWe need to dedicate greater resources, including cyber resources, to defending our elections.\nI served as a founding member of a Trans-Atlantic Commission on Election Integrity to fight back against Russia's attacks on Western democracies.\nWe asked candidates across Europe and North America to sign a pledge, committing to transparency in campaign finances and to reject the use of fabricated or hacked materials.\nNow that I am a candidate for office – I have signed that pledge, and I urge everyone running for president to do the same.\nIt's the right thing to do.\nAs individuals, and as a nation, we have to prove to the world that the United States is prepared to lead – not just with the example of our power, but the power of our example.\nTo that end, as president, I will take decisive steps to renew our core American values and return transparency to our government.\nWe believe in freedom of religion, which is why I will end the Muslim ban.\nWe believe in free speech, which is why I will end the Global Gag Rule that prevents money from going to international NGOs that even talk about family planning.\nWe believe in the power of a free press, which is why I will immediately return to daily press briefings at the White House, State Department, and Department of Defense.\nWe are a nation of immigrants. President Trump took those words out of the mission statement of our citizenship and immigration services. I will restore them.\nOur Statue of Liberty invites in the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. I will reverse Trump's detrimental asylum policies and raise our target for refugee admissions to a level commensurate with our responsibility and the unprecedented global need.\nA Biden administration would immediately end the horrific practice of separating families at our border and holding children in for-profit detention centers.\nAnd I would order a review of Temporary Protected Status to vulnerable populations\nwho cannot find safety in their countries ripped apart by violence or disaster – including Venezuelans and Haitians.\nWe've always been a nation that chooses science over fiction – and from climate change\nto standards for harmful environmental toxins to global health policy. We're going to return facts to our policy making.\nRenew a government-wide focus on uplifting the rights of women and girls, at home and abroad. And revitalize our national commitment to advancing human rights and democracy around the world.\nThese changes – and many more, which I've released on our website – are just a start – a day-one down payment on our commitment to living our democratic values at home.\nAnd then, I will invite my fellow democratic leaders to put strengthening democracy back on the global agenda.\nWe will organize and host in the United States, during the first year of my administration, a global Summit for Democracy to renew the spirit and shared purpose of the nations of the Free World.\nBuilding off the successful model we instituted during the Obama-Biden administration with the Nuclear Security Summit – leaders who attend must come prepared with concrete commitments to take on corruption, counter authoritarianism, and advance human rights in their own nations.\nWe have to be honest about our friends that are falling short and forge a common agenda for action to address the greatest threats to our shared values.\nWe'll include civil society organizations from around the world that stand on the frontlines in defense of our democracies.\nAnd we'll challenge the private sector, including tech corporations and social media giants, to make their own commitments.\nAmerica's openness fueled their success.\nNow I believe they have a duty to make sure their algorithms and platforms are not misused to sow division at home, or to empower the surveillance state, facilitate repression and censorship in China and elsewhere, spread hate, or spur people to violence.\nSecond, we will equip our people to succeed in the global economy with a foreign policy for the middle class.\nTo win the competition for the future, we must double down on sharpening our innovative edge and uniting the economic might of our friends to counter abusive economic practices.\nWe know that economic security is national security. But there are a lot of communities across this country that are hurting because we've neglected the basics.\nOur trade policy has to start at home, by strengthening our greatest asset – our middle class.\nWe have to take care of everything I've talked about on the campaign trail – giving every student the skills or training they need to obtain a good 21st century job;making sure every single American has access to quality, affordable healthcare; investing in rebuilding our bridges and roads, modernizing our airports and trains; making sure Americans have access to broadband networks; reforming our taxes to reward work, not just wealth; leading the clean-economy revolution to create 10 million new jobs right here in the United States.\nI will make investment in research and development a cornerstone of my presidency so that the United States is leading the charge with innovation.\nThere's no reason we should be falling behind China or anyone else when it comes to clean energy, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, 5G, and high-speed rail.\nAnd there's no reason that we cannot ensure that our people are ready – for the transition that will inevitably accompany this new technology.\nLadies and Gentlemen – we have the greatest research universities in the world. The most agile system of venture capital. We're virtually energy independent. We have a strong tradition of the rule of law.\nAnd most important, we have an extraordinary population of workers and innovators who have never let our country down.\nA foreign policy for the middle class will also work to make sure the rules of the international economy are not rigged against us.\nBecause when American businesses compete on a fair playing field – we win.\nPresident Trump may think he's being tough on China, but all he has delivered is more pain for American farmers, manufacturers, and consumers.\nHis economic decision making is as short-sighted as the rest of his foreign policy. China is playing the long-game – extending its global reach and investing in the technologies of the future – while Trump is designating our closest allies – from Canada to the European Union – as National Security Threats in order to impose damaging and pointless tariffs.\nBy cutting us off from the economic clout of our partners, he knee-caps our capacity to take on the real economic threat.\nWe do need to get tough with China.\nIf China has its way, it will keep robbing the U.S. of our technology and intellectual property, or forcing American companies to give it away in order to do business in China.\nAnd the most effective way to meet that challenge is to build a united front of friends and partners to challenge China's abusive behavior – even as we seek to deepen cooperation on issues where our interests converge, like climate change and preventing nuclear proliferation.\nThere's no going back to business as usual on trade. We need new rules, and a new process that has the voices of all stakeholders at the table – including leaders representing labor and the environment.\nWe must negotiate from the strongest possible position.\nOn our own, we represent about one-quarter of global GDP. When we join together with fellow democracies, that number doubles.\nChina can't afford to ignore half the global economy.\nThat gives us substantial leverage to shape the future rules of the road on everything from the environment to labor, trade, technology and transparency so they continue to reflect democratic interests and values – America's interests and values.\nNot China's. Not Russia's.\nThe world does not organize itself. If we do not shape the norms and institutions that govern relations among nations, rest assure – that some other nation will step into the vacuum, OR – no one will – and chaos will result.\nWhich brings me to my final point.\nThe Biden foreign policy agenda will place America back at the head of the table, working with our allies and partners – to mobilize global action on global threats, especially those unique to our Century.\nAmerican leadership is not infallible. We have made missteps and mistakes.\nToo often we have relied solely on the might of our military instead of drawing on our full array of strengths.\nLet me be clear – I will never hesitate to protect the American people Including, when necessary, by using force.\nAs Vice President, I worked with President Obama to craft the military and diplomatic campaign that ultimately defeated ISIS.\nIn fact, it turned out Trump's secret plan to destroy the so-called caliphate was to continue the plan we put in place.\nWe have the strongest military in the world – I would argue in the history of the world.\nAs President, I will ensure it stays that way. I will make the investments necessary – to equip our troops for the challenges of the next century, not the last one.\nBut the use of force should be our last resort, not our first.\nUsed only to defend our vital interests, when the objective is clear and achievable, and with the informed consent of the American people.\nIt's past time to end the Forever Wars, which have cost us untold blood and treasure.\nAs I have long argued, we should bring the vast majority of our troops home – from the wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East, and narrowly focus our mission on Al-Qaeda and ISIS.\nAnd we should end our support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.\nStaying entrenched – in unwinnable conflicts – drains our capacity to lead on other issues that require our attention, and it prevents us from rebuilding the other instruments of American power.\nSo I will make it my mission – to restore American leadership – and elevate diplomacy as our principal tool of foreign policy.\nI will reinvest in The Diplomatic Corps that this administration has hollowed out – and put our diplomacy back in the hands of genuine professionals.\nAbove all, diplomacy requires credibility.\nAnd Donald Trump has absolutely corroded our country's credibility.\nIn the conduct of American foreign policy – and especially in times of crisis – a President's word – is his or her most valuable asset.\nBut by pulling out of treaty after treaty, reneging on policy after policy – walking away from America's responsibilities, and lying – about matters big and small – Trump has bankrupted America's word in the world.\nAnd he has alienated us from the very democratic allies we need most.\nTrump has taken a battering ram to our NATO alliance – he treats it like an American-run protection racket.\nHe just doesn't get it.\nNATO is at the very heart of America's national security.\nAnd more than that, it's the bulwark of the liberal democratic ideal.\nIt is an alliance – first and foremost – of values.\nThat makes it far more durable, reliable, and powerful than partnerships built by coercion or cash.\nThe same is true of our core alliances in Asia.\nAnd let's be clear: working cooperatively with other nations that share our values and goals doesn't make America a sucker – it makes us more secure and more successful.\nWe amplify our own strength, extend our presence around the globe, and magnify our impact – while sharing the burden among willing partners.\nNo country, even one as powerful as ours, can go it alone against challenges that respect no borders and cannot be contained by walls.\nAs president, I will do more than just restore our historic partnerships I'll lead the effort to reimagine them – to better meet the challenges we're grappling with today.\nTo keep NATO's military capabilities sharp, while also expanding our capacity – to take on non-traditional threats like weaponized corruption, cyber theft, and new challenges in space and on the high seas.\nAnd, by the way, the increase in NATO defense spending started under the Obama-Bidenadministration.\nWe need to look for opportunities to strengthen cooperation with democratic friends – beyond North America and beyond Europe – reaching out to our partners in Asia, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, and India to fortify our collective capabilities.\nSustaining our ironclad commitment to Israel's security.\nIntegrating our friends in Latin America and Africa and seizing opportunities throughout the broader network of democracies.\nAnd in order to regain the confidence of the world – we're going to have to prove that America says what it means, and means what it says.\nEspecially when it comes to the challenges that will define our time: the renewed threat of nuclear war, mass migration, disruptive technology, and climate change.\nWe cannot be a credible voice on non-proliferation and nuclear security while we are abandoning the deals we negotiated.\nFrom North Korea to Iran, Russia to Saudi Arabia, Trump has made the prospect of nuclear proliferation, a new nuclear arms race, and even the use of nuclear weapons more likely.\nI've worked on these issues my entire adult life. I understand what's at stake and I understand the consequences of failing to act.\nThat is why, as President, I would renew our commitment to arms control for a new era.\nThe historic Iran nuclear deal we negotiated blocked Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.\nYet Trump cast it aside, prompting Iran to restart its nuclear program and become more provocative – raising the risk of another disastrous war in the region.\nIf Tehran returns to compliance with the deal, I would re-join the agreement and work with our allies to strengthen and extend it,while more effectively pushing back against Iran's other destabilizing activities.\nIn North Korea, I will empower our negotiators and jumpstart a sustained, coordinated campaign with our allies and others – including China – to advance our shared objective of a denuclearized North Korea.\nI will pursue an extension of the New START Treaty, an anchor of strategic stability between the United States and Russia, and use that as a foundation for new arms control arrangements.\nAnd I would take other steps to demonstrate our commitment to reducing the role of nuclear weapons.\nAs I said in 2017, I believe the sole purpose of the U.S. nuclear arsenal should be deterring – and if necessary, retaliating against a nuclear attack. As president, I will work to put that belief into practice, in consultation with our Allies and our military.\nBy the same measure, we cannot push nations to meet their humanitarian obligations to address the biggest refugee and migration crisis since World War II if we are not living our democratic values and firmly rejecting Trump's nativist rhetoric.\nIt shames our nation when a father and his baby daughter drown seeking our shores, when children are locked away in overcrowded detention centers – denied even the most basic necessities – when families are ripped apart.\nAbandoning our deepest-held values does nothing to increase security at our border – and everything to diminish our standing in the world.\nWe need sensible policies that improve screening procedures at our legal ports of entry and make smart investments in border technology.\nWe need to work again with Canada and Mexico as neighbors – not adversaries.\nAnd we need to focus on the root causes driving migrants to our border.\nAs Vice President, I secured commitments from the leaders of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to take on the corruption, violence, and endemic poverty in their countries that are driving people to leave their homes.\nThen I worked with a Republican Congress to approve a $750 million aid package to help support those reforms.\nAnd guess what – it worked. Security improved and migration flows began to decrease in countries like El Salvador.\nTrump announced an end to our aid – to Central America – via tweet, with no understanding of the consequences.\nIf elected President, I will relaunch that initiative, with a top-to-bottom review of our funding to the region to determine how we can continue to drive reforms that deliver results.\nWhen it comes to the technologies of the future – like 5-G and Artificial Intelligence – Other nations are devoting national resources to dominating their development and determining how they are used.\nWe have to ensure that 21st century technologies are used to promote greater democracy and shared prosperity– not to curb – freedom and opportunity at home and abroad.\nAs new technologies reshape our economy and society, we must ensure that these engines for progress are bound by laws and ethics as we've done at every technological turning point in history.\nA Biden administration will join together with our democratic allies to develop secure, private-sector led 5-G networks, leaving no community – rural or low income – behind.\nAnd the last example I'll end on today is how the United States must lead the world to take on the existential threat we face – climate change.\nIf we don't get this right, nothing else matters.\nI'll put us on track to achieve a clean-energy economy with net-zero emissions by 2050.\nAnd, equally important because the United States is only 15 percent of global emissions, I'll leverage our economic and our moral authority to push the world to urgent action.\nI will rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and convene a summit of the world's largest carbon emitters, rallying nations to raise their ambitions and push our progress further – faster.\nWe'll lock in enforceable commitments that will reduce emissions in global shipping and aviation – and we'll pursue strong measures to make sure other nations can't undercut us economically as we meet our own commitments.\nThat includes insisting that China, the world's largest emitter of carbon, stops subsidizing coal exports and outsourcing pollution to other countries by financing billions of dollars of dirty fossil-fuel energy projects through their Belt and Road Initiative.\nThese are ambitious goals and we won't accomplish any of them without the United States – flanked by our fellow democracies – leading the way.\nWe are facing enemies – both without and within – hoping to exploit the fissures in our society, undermine our democracy, break up our alliances, and return us to an international system where might determines right.\nThe answer to this threat is more openness – not less. More friendships, more cooperation, more alliances. More democracy.\nVladimir Putin wants to tell himself and anyone he can dupe into believing him that the liberal idea is \"obsolete\" – because he's afraid of its power.\nNo army on earth can match – how the Electric Idea of Liberty – passes freely from person to person, jumps borders, transcends languages and cultures – how it can supercharge communities of ordinary citizens into activists and organizers and change agents.\nWe must once more harness that power and rally the Free World to meet the challenges facing our world today. And it falls to the United States of America to lead the way.\nNo other nation has the capacity. No other nation is built on that idea – that promise.\nAnd it's in our self-interest.\nWe have to champion liberty and democracy. We have to reclaim our credibility. We have to look with unrelenting optimism and determination toward the future.\nThank you, and God protect our troops.\n",

    "text": "\nToday, Joe Biden laid out his foreign policy vision for America to restore dignified leadership at home and respected leadership on the world stage. Arguing that our policies at home and abroad are deeply connected, Joe Biden announced that, as president, he will advance the security, prosperity, and values of the United States by taking immediate steps to renew our own democracy and alliances, protect our economic future, and once more place America at the head of the table, leading the world to address the most urgent global challenges.\nIn a Biden administration, America will lead by example and rally the world to meet our common challenges that no one nation can face on its own, from climate change to nuclear proliferation, from great power aggression to transnational terrorism, from cyberwarfare to mass migration. Donald Trump's erratic policies and failure to uphold basic democratic principles have surrendered our position in the world, undermined our democratic alliances, weakened our ability to mobilize others to meet these challenges, and threatened our security and our future.\nIn a speech at The Graduate Center at CUNY in New York, Joe Biden laid out his blueprint to repair the damage wrought by President Trump and chart a fundamentally different course for American foreign policy for the world as we find it today—and as we anticipate it will be tomorrow. Biden will continue to build on this vision over the course of the campaign.\nI. Reinvigorate our Own Democracy & Strengthen the Coalition of Democracies that Stand With Us\nDemocracy is the root of our society, the wellspring of our power, and the source of our renewal. It strengthens and amplifies our leadership to keep us safe in the world. It is the engine of our ingenuity that drives our economic prosperity. It is the heart of who we are and how we see the world—and how the world sees us. That is why America's ability to be a force for progress in the world and to mobilize collective action starts at home. The United States must lead not just with the example of power, but the power of our example.\nAmong his early actions as president, Joe Biden will:\nReinforce our Democracy\n\nRemake our education system so that a child's opportunity in life isn't determined by their zip code or race;\nReform our criminal justice system to eliminate inequitable disparities;\nRestore the Voting Rights Act;\nSeek greater transparency in our campaign finance system so money, foreign and domestic, won't pollute our politics;\nDedicate greater resources, including cyber resources, to defending our election systems.\nEnd the practice of anonymous shell companies;\nInstitute strict conflict-of-interest and anti-corruption policies for every member of the Biden administration so there will be no more self-dealing;\nImmediately return to daily press briefings at the White House, U.S. Department of State, and U.S. Department of Defense. Our foreign policy relies on the informed consent of the American people. That is not possible when our government refuses to communicate with the public.\n\nRestore our Moral Leadership\n\nImmediately end the horrific practice of separating families at our border and holding immigrant children in for-profit prisons. Abandoning our deepest-held values does nothing to increase security at our border—and everything to diminish our standing in the world. At the same time, as president, Biden will establish sensible policies that improve screening procedures at our legal ports of entry and make smart investments in border technology, in cooperation with Canada and Mexico.\nProtect undocumented members of our armed services, veterans, and their spouses from deportation because if you are willing to risk your life for this country, you and your family have earned the chance to live safe, healthy, and productive lives in America;\nOrder a review of Temporary Protected Status to vulnerable populations who cannot find safety in countries ripped apart by violence or disaster, including for Venezuelans and Haitians.\nTerminate the travel ban against people from Muslim-majority countries;\nReverse Trump's detrimental asylum policies and raise our target for refugee admissions to a level commensurate with our responsibility and unprecedented global need;\nEnd the Global Gag Rule, which prevents money from going to international NGOs that even talk about abortion;\nReturn to a government-wide focus of uplifting the rights of women and girls at home and around the world, including by focusing on measures to address gender-based violence internationally.\nReaffirm the ban on torture and restore greater transparency in our military operations, including policies instituted during the Obama-Biden administration to reduce civilian casualties;\nRestore a commitment to science and truth in government, including bringing back the words \"climate change\";\nReturn the phrase \"nation of immigrants\" to the mission statement of our Citizenship and Immigration Services, because that is who we are.\nRevitalize our national commitment to advancing human rights and democracy around the world.\n\nHaving taken these essential steps to reinforce the democratic foundation of our country and inspire action in others, President Biden will organize and host a global Summit for Democracy to renew the spirit and shared purpose of the nations of the Free World. During his first year in office, President Biden will bring together the world's democracies to strengthen our democratic institutions, honestly confront the challenge of nations that are backsliding, and forge a common agenda to address threats to our common values.\n\nThe Summit will prioritize results by galvanizing significant new country commitments in three areas: (1) fighting corruption; (2) defending against authoritarianism, including election security; (3) advancing human rights in their own nations and abroad.\nThe Summit will include civil society organizations from around the world that stand on the frontlines in defense of our democracies.\nThe Summit will also issue a Call to Action for the private sector, including technology corporations and social media giants, to make their own commitments, recognizing their responsibilities and their overwhelming interest in preserving open, democratic societies and protecting free speech. For example, technology companies—which benefit from the fruits of democracy—should make concrete pledges for how they can ensure their algorithms and platforms are not empowering the surveillance state, facilitating repression in China and elsewhere, spreading hate, spurring people to violence, and remaining susceptible to misuse.\n\nAs an example of the concrete action our world needs, Joe Biden served as a founding member of a Trans-Atlantic Commission on Election Integrity—to fight back against Russia's attacks on Western democracies. The Commission asked politicians across Europe to sign a pledge committing to transparency in campaign finance and to reject the use of fabricated or hacked material. Now that he is a candidate for office, Biden has signed that pledge and is calling on every person running for president to do the same.\nII. Equip our People to Succeed in a Global Economy with a Foreign Policy for the Middle Class\nJoe Biden believes that economic security is national security. That is why, as president, Biden will pursue a foreign policy for the middle class. To win the competition for the future against China or anyone else, we must sharpen our innovative edge and unite the economic might of democracies around the world to counter abusive economic practices.\nRebuild the Middle Class, the Backbone of the Country: Give every student the skills they need to obtain a good 21st century job; make sure every single American has access to quality, affordable healthcare; invest in infrastructure; raise the minimum wage to $15; and lead the clean-economy revolution to create 10 million new jobs in the United States.\nInvest in Our Innovative Edge: Unleash our nation's full potential—which includes unrivaled research universities, unparalleled venture capital, and our citizens' unmatched spirit of entrepreneurship and commitment to hard work—with investments in research and development to spur advances in clean energy, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, 5G, and high-speed rail. We must ensure the technologies of the future like AI are bound by laws and ethics and promote greater shared prosperity and democracy. A Biden administration will join together with our democratic allies to develop secure, private sector-led 5G networks, leaving no community—rural or low-income—behind.\nEnsure the Rules of Road Benefit our Workers and our Communities: There is no going back to business as usual on trade. And he will ensure we negotiate from the strongest possible position. Joining with our fellow democracies, we represent about one-half of global GDP. As president, Biden will use this substantial leverage to shape the future rules of the road on everything from the environment to labor to trade to transparency, non-proliferation to cyber theft, and data privacy to artificial intelligence, so they continue to reflect democratic interests and values—America's interests and values.\nIII. Renew American Leadership to Mobilize Global Action on Global Threats\nThe world does not organize itself. American leadership, backed by clear goals and sound strategies, is necessary to effectively address the defining global challenges of our time. In order to lead again, we must restore our credibility and influence. From day one of a Biden administration, other countries will once again have reason to trust and respect the word of an American president. Working together, democracies can and must confront the rise of populists, nationalists, and demagogues; the growing strength of autocratic powers and their efforts to divide and manipulate democracies; and the threats unique to our time, including the renewed threat of nuclear war, mass migration, the disruptive impact of new technologies, and climate change.\nDefend our Vital Interests: As president, Biden will never hesitate to protect the American people, including when necessary, by using force. We have the strongest military in the world—and as president, Biden will ensure it stays that way. The Biden administration will make the investments necessary to equip our troops for the challenges of the next century, not the last one. But the use of force should be our last resort, not our first—used only to defend our vital interests, when the objective is clear and achievable, and with the informed consent of the American people.\nEnd Forever Wars: Biden will end the forever wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East, which have cost us untold blood and treasure. As he has long argued, Biden will bring the vast majority of our troops home from Afghanistan and narrowly focus our mission on Al-Qaeda and ISIS. And he will end our support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Staying entrenched in unwinnable conflicts only drains our capacity to lead on other issues that require our attention, and it prevents us from rebuilding the other instruments of American power.\nElevate Diplomacy: As president, Biden will elevate diplomacy as the premier tool of our global engagement. He will rebuild a modern, agile U.S. Department of State—investing in and re-empowering the finest diplomatic corps in the world and leveraging the full talent and richness of America's diversity. Working cooperatively with other nations makes us more secure and more successful. For example, as president, Biden will launch a top-to-bottom review of our funding to Central America to determine how we can build on a successful initiative from the Obama-Biden administration that secured concrete commitments from the leaders of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to take on the corruption, violence, and endemic poverty that drive migration.\nRestore and Reimagine Partnerships: A Biden administration will do more than restore our historic partnerships; it will lead the effort to reimagine them for the future. This means keeping NATO's military capabilities sharp, while also expanding our capacity to take on new, non-traditional threats like weaponized corruption, cyber theft, and new challenges in space and on the high seas; calling on all NATO nations to recommit to their responsibilities as members of a democratic alliance; and strengthening cooperation with democratic partners beyond North America and Europe by reaching out to our partners in Asia to fortify our collective capabilities and integrating our friends in Latin America and Africa. When the United States hosts the next Summit of the Americas in 2021, President Biden will harness this opportunity to rebuild strong hemispheric ties based on respect for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. We will also strengthen our alliances with Japan, South Korea, Australia and other Asian democracies, while sustaining an ironclad commitment to Israel's security.\nRenew our Commitment to Arms Control for a New Era:\n\nThe historic Iran nuclear deal, negotiated by the Obama-Biden administration alongside our allies and other world powers, blocked Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Yet Trump decided to cast it aside, prompting Iran to restart its nuclear program and become more provocative, bringing the region to the cusp of another disastrous war. If Tehran returns to compliance with the deal, President Biden would re-enter the agreement, using hard-nosed diplomacy and support from our allies to strengthen and extend it, while more effectively pushing back against Iran's other destabilizing activities.\nIn North Korea, President Biden will empower our negotiators and jump start a sustained, coordinated campaign with our allies and others, including China, to advance our shared objective of a denuclearized North Korea.\nAs president, Biden will pursue an extension of the New START Treaty, an anchor of strategic stability between the United States and Russia, and use that as a foundation for new arms control arrangements.\nPresident Biden would take other steps to demonstrate our commitment to reducing the role of nuclear weapons. As he said in 2017, Biden believes the sole purpose of the U.S. nuclear arsenal should be deterring—and if necessary, retaliating against—a nuclear attack. As president, he will work to put that belief into practice, in consultation with our allies and military.\n\nRally the World to Address Existential Climate Crisis: The Biden administration will rejoin the Paris Climate Accord on day one and lead a major diplomatic push to raise the ambitions of countries' climate targets. To catalyze this effort and demonstrate concrete actions at home to achieve a clean-energy economy with net-zero emissions by 2050, President Biden – as outlined in his comprehensive plan – will in his first 100 days in office:\n\nConvene a climate world summit to directly engage the leaders of the major carbon-emitting nations of the world to persuade them to join the United States in making more ambitious national pledges, above and beyond the commitments they have already made.\nLock in enforceable commitments that will reduce emissions in global shipping and aviation—and pursue strong measures to make sure other nations can't undercut us economically as we meet our own commitments. This includes pressuring China—the world's largest emitter of carbon—to stop subsidizing coal exports and outsourcing their pollution to other countries by financing billions of dollars of dirty fossil-fuel energy projects through their Belt and Road Initiative.\n\n",

    "text": "\nRural America is home to roughly 20% of Americans, but we are all connected to rural communities in many ways. Rural Americans fuel us and feed us. Rural lands provide us with places to spend time outdoors with friends and family and relax.\nA healthy, vibrant rural America is essential to the success of our country. Yet in small town after small town, parents watch their kids and grandkids leave rural communities because there just is not enough opportunity for them at home. For too many rural Americans, a pathway to the middle class is out of reach if they stay in their rural communities.\nThe moral obligation of our time is rebuilding the middle class, so that this time everyone comes along regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, disability or zip code. It should not be dependent on whether they live in a city center, a small town, or a remote area. Everyone means everyone.\nAs president, Biden will build a pathway to the middle class for rural Americans, in rural America. He will pursue a rural economic development strategy that partners with rural communities to invest in their unique assets, with the goal of giving young people more options to live, work, and raise the next generation in rural America. It's not just good for those in rural America, it's good for everyone across our country.\nI. FUNDAMENTALLY REVITALIZE RURAL ECONOMIES\nRural America is asset-rich. It feeds and fuels the rest of the country, gives us places to enjoy the outdoors and spend time with friends and family, and is home to creative, hard-working Americans. Yet rural America's economy is traditionally based on extraction, taking the resources out of rural communities and never returning the profits.\nThe Biden strategy for rural economic development will be to partner with rural communities, invest in their unique assets, and make sure the wealth created in rural America stays in rural America.\nUnder this strategy, Biden will:\nStrengthen our agricultural sector by:\n\nPursuing a trade policy that works for American farmers. More than 20% of all crops grown and products raised in the United States are exported, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs and helping to stabilize farm income. But America's farmers and rural communities have paid a heavy price for President Trump's tariffs. While Trump is pursuing a damaging and erratic trade war without any real strategy, President Biden will stand up to China by working with our allies to negotiate from the strongest possible position. And, he'll make sure our trade policy works for American farmers.\nSupporting beginning farmers. America tries to make it easy to start a business, but unless you inherit the land, it's much more difficult to start a farm. The Biden Administration will expand the Obama-Biden Administration's microloan program for new and beginning farmers, doubling the maximum loan amount to $100,000. And, it will increase funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's farm ownership and operating loans that typically serve beginning farmers who grew up on a family farm but need low-cost capital to add to their family's operation to support another household.\nFostering the development of regional food systems. The Biden Administration will partner with small and mid-sized farmers to help them collectively create supply chains to deliver fresh produce and other products to schools, hospitals, and other major state and federal institutions, including the Defense Department. This will allow these farmers to negotiate their own prices. And, it will help farmers identify markets for specialty crops and secondary products, like ice cream produced by dairy farmers to bring in additional revenue.\nRe-investing in land grant universities' agricultural research so the public, not private companies, owns patents to agricultural advances. The Biden Administration will reinvest in agricultural research by bolstering funding for the Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. Our farmers need new technologies to compete in world markets while protecting our soil and water. These new technologies – and the next new seeds – should be developed and owned by the American people, not private companies who can use patents to expand profits.\nPartnering with farmers to make American agriculture first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions, giving farmers new sources of income in the process. Many farmers are some of the best stewards of our land, air, and water. The government needs to partner with them to accelerate progress toward net-zero emissions. As president, Biden will ensure our agricultural sector is the first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions, and that our farmers earn income as we meet this milestone. Toward this end, the Biden Administration will dramatically expand and fortify the pioneering Conservation Stewardship Program, created by former Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Tom Harkin, to support farm income through payments based on farmers' practices to protect the environment, including carbon sequestration. In addition to seeking full federal funding for the program, the Biden Administration will ensure the program can participate in carbon markets. Corporations, individuals, and foundations interested in promoting greenhouse gas reductions could offset their emissions by contributing to Conservation Stewardship Program payments to farmers for those sequestering carbon -- for example, through cover crops. This will not only help combat climate change, which Vice President Biden has called an existential threat, but also create additional revenue sources for farmers at a time when many are struggling to make ends meet. And, this approach will create a whole series of new businesses that survey, measure, certify, and quantify conservation results. In addition, the Biden Plan will make a significant investment in research to refine practices to build soil carbon while maximizing farm and ranch productivity. Soil is the next frontier for storing carbon.\nStrengthening antitrust enforcement. From the inputs they depend on – such as seeds – to the markets where they sell their products, American farmers and ranchers are being hurt by increasing market concentration. The Biden Administration will protect small and medium-sized farmers and producers by strengthening enforcement of the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts and the Packers and Stockyards Act.\nExpand bio-based manufacturing to bring cutting-edge manufacturing jobs back to rural America. The Biden Administration will create a low-carbon manufacturing sector in every state in the country, but not just in cities. As president, Biden will grow the bioeconomy and bio-based manufacturing to bring cutting-edge manufacturing jobs back to rural America. This means taking every aspect of agricultural production – from corn stock to manure – to create chemicals, materials, fabrics, and fibers in a process that is good for the environment and creates new sources of revenue for farmers. Key to this strategy will be connecting research universities, community colleges, incubators and accelerators, manufacturing institutes, employers, unions, and state and local governments – alone or as part of a regional pact. The federal government will provide them with significant funding for deployment of a place-based plan to help their state or region build a competitive and low-carbon future in manufacturing that reflects climate impacts in their local communities.\n\nPromote ethanol and the next generation of biofuels. Joe Biden believes renewable fuels are vital to the future of rural America – and the climate. The Biden Plan will invest $400 billion in clean energy research, innovation, and deployment – more than twice what America spent to put a man on the moon. And, as part of this effort, developing the next generation of biofuels will be a top priority. The Biden Plan will invest in research to develop cellulosic biofuels in a manner that protects our soil and water and addresses the challenge of climate change, while turning grass, crop residues, and other biomass into fuel. Doubling down on these liquid fuels of the future will not only make value-added agriculture a key part of the solution to climate change – reducing emissions in planes, ships, and other forms of transportation – but will also create quality jobs across rural America. From day one, President Biden will use every tool at his disposal, including the federal fleet and the federal government's purchasing power, to promote and advance renewable energy, ethanol, and other biofuels.\nInvest in wind and solar energy. President Obama put Vice President Biden in charge of the Recovery Act, which invested more than $90 billion in clean energy technology. Those investments contributed to a doubling of the share of domestically produced wind turbine components and produced a dramatic decrease in solar costs, making wind and solar power cost-competitive. Biden will build on the Recovery Act by setting an ambitious but essential goal for America to achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions no later than 2050. His clean energy plan will accelerate the already dramatic growth of solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources.\nInvest $20 billion in rural broadband infrastructure, and triple funding to expand broadband access in rural areas. High-speed broadband is essential in the 21st Century economy. Yet far too many rural communities still don't have access to it. Rural Americans are over 10 times more likely than urban residents to lack quality broadband access. At a time when so many jobs and businesses could be located anywhere, high-speed internet access should be a great economic equalizer for rural America, not another economic disadvantage. Investing $20 billion in rural broadband infrastructure has the potential to create more than a quarter million new jobs. The Biden Plan will triple Community Connect broadband grants and partner with municipal utilities to bring cutting-edge broadband connections to communities across rural America.\nInvest in green infrastructure nationwide. As president, Biden will make smart infrastructure investments to rebuild the nation and to ensure that our buildings, water, transportation, and energy infrastructure can meet America's economic needs and withstand the impacts of climate change. The Biden Administration will use this infrastructure funding to ensure that rural communities across the country have access to clean, safe drinking water. It will modernize the lock and dam system vital to getting rural products to markets, leveraging the federal resources to the maximum extent possible with the private sector. And, it will build the roads to give farms and small town businesses access to markets and an efficient means to participate in the world economy.\nExpand access to credit for new and small businesses. Entrepreneurs in small towns and rural areas should have access to the capital they need to realize their dreams. The Biden Administration will dramatically expand funding for Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and the Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance Program to help rural entrepreneurs. Biden will expand the number of Rural Business Investment Companies to help rural companies obtain capital.\nII. PARTNER WITH RURAL COMMUNITIES TO HELP THEM FULLY ACCESS FEDERAL RESOURCES\nA contributing factor to place-based inequality across the U.S. is the simple fact that some communities are more successful at accessing federal dollars and technical assistance than others. The federal government's programs are too often too challenging to navigate for cities and towns that do not have the ability to hire highly qualified professionals to engage with the system.\nThe Biden Administration wants to fundamentally change how the federal government interacts with rural communities that so often do not have access to federal programs. The Biden Administration will partner with these communities to help them fully access federal resources to create jobs, build wealth, and give rural Americans who live in poverty the chance to join the middle class.\nThe Biden Administration will do this in two ways:\n\nCreate a White House \"StrikeForce\" to partner with rural communities to help them access federal funds. The Biden Administration will create a White House StrikeForce consisting of agency leaders who will partner with community-building organizations in persistent poverty rural communities and help them unlock federal resources. This approach is modeled on the StrikeForce Secretary Tom Vilsack successfully established in the U.S. Department of Agriculture during the Obama-Biden Administration.\nPrioritize persistent poverty rural communities. Approximately 85% of roughly 350 persistent poverty counties in the United States fall outside of a metropolitan area. To tackle persistent poverty in all communities, but especially rural America, Vice President Biden supports applying Congressman James Clyburn's 10-20-30 formula, which will allocate 10 percent of funding to areas \"where 20 percent or more of the population has been living below the poverty line for the last 30 years,\" to all federal programs.\n\nIII. PROTECT AND BUILD ON THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTH CARE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES\nThe Affordable Care Act was a big deal in rural America, and it should be protected and built upon. As president, Biden will protect and build on Obamacare – not get rid of it and start over with something new. He will not support any policy that means getting rid of Obamacare, whether proposed by a Democrat or Republican.\nVice President Biden believes that every American has a right to the peace of mind that comes with knowing they have health insurance and access to affordable, quality health care. He believes that it's a right, not a privilege. It should not be dependent on whether they live in a city center, a small town, or a remote community.\nRural America faces unique challenges and opportunities when it comes to access to quality health care. In many rural communities, the local hospital is one of the largest – if not the largest – employers. Keeping our rural hospitals open is critical not only for saving lives, but also for supporting local economies in rural America. Yet, since 2010, more than 100 rural hospitals across the United States have closed. Combined, these closures represent the loss of over 10,000 jobs. And, they could mean life or death for patients in rural communities. Already, someone injured in a rural area has to travel, on average, nearly twice as far to get to the closest hospital as someone injured in an urban area. These critical moments lost in travel time are one reason an estimated 60% of all trauma fatalities occur in rural communities.\nThis problem is at risk of getting even worse. Roughly 1 out of 3 rural hospitals are at risk of shutting down. And that's only part of the story. Rural clinics and rural nursing homes are closing as well.\nYou can read Vice President Biden's full health care plan here. To specifically help rural Americans, his plan will also:\nKeep our rural hospitals open by:\n\nDefending the Affordable Care Act. The first step to save our rural hospitals is to defend the Affordable Care Act. In fact, one proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act would have caused $1.7 billion in cuts to rural hospitals, 181 additional rural hospitals \"forced into the red,\" and nearly 38,000 lost jobs. President Biden isn't going to eliminate the Affordable Care Act, he's going to build on it.\nFinishing the job of expanding coverage to low-income adults. Research found that, in states that took up the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, the expansion was a critical tool in keeping rural hospitals open. Yet, 14 states have still not expanded Medicaid eligibility, and an estimated 4.9 million individuals would be eligible for coverage but for their state's inaction. Vice President Biden's plan will enroll all of these individuals in a new public option, without a premium and with benefits like those offered in Medicaid. This isn't just the right thing to do, it will help rural hospitals remain solvent. And, under the Biden Plan, which preserves individuals ability to choose private insurance, these hospitals won't be threatened by having to get by on low Medicare reimbursement rates for all.\nGiving rural hospitals the flexibility they need to keep their doors open and care for their patients. The Biden Administration will provide rural health care providers with funding and flexibility necessary to identify, test, and deploy innovative approaches to keeping their doors open and providing care for the unique needs of rural communities. The Affordable Care Act supports this type of innovation, for example through demonstration projects like the Pennsylvania Rural Health Model, which is giving rural hospitals in the state more flexibility to decide how best to spend dollars to improve the health of the population they serve. The Biden Plan will expand funding for these types of demonstration projects, and then accelerate efforts to replicate proven models to other rural hospitals across the country. And, the Biden Plan will identify and eliminate federal rules making it harder for rural hospitals to serve their communities. For example, many rural hospitals serving small populations do not have enough patients to maintain inpatient care, but those communities still need a 24/7 emergency department. One approach to ensure they can keep their doors open is to create a new designation, the Community Outpatient Hospital, as proposed in the bipartisan Save Rural Hospitals Act. The Biden Administration will make sure the federal government is helping rural hospitals meet community needs, not serving as a roadblock.\nAdequately funding our rural hospitals. To help hospitals keep their doors open, President Biden supports the elimination of payment cuts and additional payments for rural hospitals as detailed in the bipartisan Save Rural Hospitals Act.\n\nExpand primary care and innovative health care delivery models in rural communities by:\n\nDoubling funding for community health centers. Community health centers provide primary, prenatal, and other important care to underserved populations. The Biden Plan will double the federal investment in these centers, expanding access to high quality health care for the populations that need it most. More than half of community health centers are in rural areas.\nEquipping rural community health centers to be hubs for healthy communities. As president, Biden will establish a grant program to help community health centers hire social workers or other professionals to coordinate resources necessary for community health, such as transportation to get patients to health centers and connections to housing and nutrition services.\nExpanding the pipeline of rural health care providers. The Biden Administration will use a comprehensive approach to increase the number of rural individuals going to medical school or other training programs and returning or staying in rural communities to provide care, with a focus on primary care physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, nurse anesthetists, and other in-demand providers. This initiative will include additional funding for residency programs in rural areas, expanding the National Health Service Corps, and developing high school-community-college-health-center partnerships to inspire rural youth to pursue jobs in health care and pursue the advanced credits or industry credentials that will put them on the path to success in the field.\nBuilding new health clinics and deploying telehealth in rural America. The Obama-Biden Administration successfully used the USDA Community Facility Direct Loan & Grant Program to build rural hospitals and mental health clinics across rural America and equip them with the best technology. As president, Biden will expand this grant funding, with a focus on accelerating the deployment of telehealth for mental health and specialty care. Telehealth – the use of videoconferencing and other technology to provide remote care – can be a vital resource for rural communities with limited access to providers.\n\n------\nPreviously Released Biden Plans & Rural America\nTo Protect & Build on the Affordable Care Act, including a public option, which will give rural Americans a new health insurance choice, and other policies to lower health care costs.\nFor Educators, Students, and Our Future, which will triple funding for Title I schools,\nincluding those in rural communities, and expand high school-community college-business partnerships to prepare students for good jobs.\nFor a Clean Energy Revolution and Climate Justice, which commits our country to fulfilling our obligation to all workers impacted by the energy transition, like coal miners and power plant workers and their communities.\nIn the months ahead, Biden will release a higher education proposal which will include a policy to support small, low-endowment private colleges that are often anchor institutions in rural communities.\n",

    "text": "\nDES MOINES – Following Vice President Joe Biden's visit to Northwest Iowa last week, community leaders and advocates from Sioux City and Council Bluffs formally endorsed Vice President Biden's candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president.\n\"By believing in the dignity and decency of every American – and that our finest hour is still ahead, Vice President Biden is emboldening leaders and caucus-goers across Iowa,\" said Biden for President Iowa State Director Jake Braun. \"From Sioux City to Council Bluffs, community leaders, first responders, and advocates are standing with Vice President Biden because they know that with his leadership, we can reunite this country, restore the soul of America, and rebuild the middle class.\"\nJoining in calling for Vice President Biden's nomination include: Iowa State Representative Tim Kacena, longtime lawyer and 2014 congressional candidate David O'Brien, Emmy award-nominated violence prevention documentary executive producer and Executive Director of the Waitt Institute for Violence Prevention Cindy Waitt, community leader and attorney Terry O'Brien, Former Woodbury County Democratic chairman Dave Somsky, and community leader and retired social worker Connie Gronstal.\n\"As a firefighter for 33 years, I know what dedication your community to the point of running toward the flames really means – and Joe Biden not only shares that same heart and commitment, but he has respect for those who put their lives on the line,\" said Iowa State Representative Tim Kacena. \"We're on the brink of dangerous times in this country, but Joe has never shied away from a challenge before – and helped lift this country from economic crisis. We need a president that restores dignity, respect, and can bring steady leadership to the White House from Day One – and that's Joe Biden.\"\n\"We need more principle, more respect, and more belief that America is still great in the White House,\" said longtime lawyer and 2014 congressional candidate David O'Brien. \"We need the kind of president that will reach for the moon in this generation's fight to end cancer. That's the leader Joe Biden has always been – and it's the compassionate friend I've always known. One who works to resolve the most complex problems on the world stage, and still make it back for the funeral of a friend's loved one. We need more of that Joe Biden friendship, compassion, and dogged leadership in the White House that still believes that the best for our country is yet to come.\"\n\"As a longtime advocate against abuse and violence, I know Joe Biden will be the voice for the voiceless that we need in the White House. From his fight to pass landmark the Violence Against Women Act, to championing the affordable, quality health services everyone deserves, Joe Biden never leaves anyone behind,\" said Emmy award-nominated violence prevention documentary executive producer and Executive Director of the Waitt Institute for Violence Prevention Cindy Waitt. \"It's that commitment to the dignity of every person that's helped him bring victims of abuse out of the shadows and their perpetrators to justice. We need Joe Biden because he has not only the knowledge and respect that comes from years of advocacy, but the good character and kind heart to bring dignity to the office of the president – both here and around the world.\"\n\"Vice President Biden is the leader we not only need, but he's the only person who can hit the ground running on Day One with the experience and respect America needs to begin solving challenges at home and around the globe,\" said community leader and attorney Terry O'Brien. \"That's because Joe has always been able to fight effectively because he believes not just in what he's fighting for, but who he's fighting for. He's as kind and loyal as the day is long and we need more of that not only in the White House, but in communities across the country.\"\n\"Our nation and our world need the kind of dignity that Joe Biden shows every person he meets,\" said Former Woodbury County Democratic chairman Dave Somsky. \"Since my early days as his Woodbury County volunteer in 1987 and coordinator 2007 to my work as an educator today, that's the respect I've always seen from Joe. From his support for teachers and the educational opportunities our kids need and every student deserves, to his ability to reestablish trust with our partners around the world, our country needs Joe – now more than ever before.\"\n\"As a retired social worker and advocate for children and families, I've long respected Joe Biden's commitment to families, our communities, and his lifelong career serving our country,\" said community leader and retired social worker Connie Gronstal. \"From the compassion he's shown my family when loved ones have passed to the dignity he shows every worker, we need Joe Biden in the White House because he both empathizes and builds with the dogged optimism that can remind us that even through the darkest of times, our greatest days are yet to come.\"\n",

Neal Smith cited Vice President Biden's decades of common-sense leadership and steadfast commitment to Iowa communities:\n\"In all of my years serving Iowa, seldom have I had the opportunity to work with a leader that not only understood the needs of Iowa families and businesses, but championed their cause as effectively as Vice President Joe Biden,\" said former U.S. Congressman Neal Smith (D-IA). \"Joe has the cool and deliberate disposition, and the straight-shooting common sense that disarmed even the most stubborn opposition across the aisle. Whenever Joe and I worked together, we were able to achieve milestones – from establishing the Violence Against Women Act that helped bring domestic violence out of the shadows, to developing the insurance safety net programs Iowa families and businesses still depend on today when natural disasters like severe flooding strikes. I'm proud to support my friend Joe Biden for President of the United States because he's without a shadow of a doubt the most equipped to handle our challenges from day one, and to win back the White House.\"\nDr. Jill Biden will stump for Vice President Biden in Iowa later this week on Aug. 1 and 2, attending office openings in Sioux City and Council Bluffs and meet-and-greets in Glenwood and Clarinda. Vice President Biden and Dr. Biden will return to the Hawkeye State for a campaign swing from Aug. 7-10 and Vice President Biden again on Aug. 20-21.\n",

Dr. Frantz Whitfield, Senior Minister, Mount Carmel Baptist Missionary Church\nMegan Rucker, Educator from Davenport\nPatrick Riley, Attorney and Community Activist from Cedar Rapids\nKyle Cirkyl, U.S. Army Veteran and Engineer from Cedar Rapids\nMiyoko Hikiji, Veteran and Advocate from Urbandale\nEllen Goodmann Miller, Community and Resource Development Specialist from Dubuque\nJesse McCunniff, Iowa National Guard Veteran and Community Activist from Waterloo\n\nIn endorsing Vice President Biden, the young leaders from Waterloo, Cedar Rapids, Sioux City, Dubuque, Davenport and Urbandale said the following:\n\"As a fire fighter and a proud union leader, I know no one has had our backs more than Joe Biden,\" said International Association of Firefighters (IAFF) member and Iowa Professional Fire Fighters (IPFF) Executive Board Trustee Sarah Orwig. \"And as a military veteran, I've fought for the respect and dignity the United States deserves abroad that Joe Biden would restore. We need a president who looks up to, not down on, the working class the way Joe always has. Who will fight to build us back up, not tear us down – from bringing back collective bargaining rights that have been ripped to shreds in Iowa, to commanding the respect from our adversaries abroad through real negotiations, not thoughtless tweets. If we're serious about the future of working people and the security of this country, we need to elect Joe Biden as our President of the United States.\"\n\"I've been preaching since the age of 13 years old – and throughout my life I've been blessed to help others seek out the compassion, dignity, and decency that lies not only within ourselves, but in our neighbors, in our community and in our world,\" said Reverend Dr. Frantz Whitfield, Senior Minister, Mount Carmel Baptist Missionary Church. \"Joe Biden is the leader who's always lived those values. As a Faith Adviser during the Obama-Biden Administration, I've seen that leadership firsthand. I've seen Joe Biden's dogged determination to make sure good wins out – from ensuring the human right of quality, affordable health care, to making sure love trumps hate across our nation. Joe Biden is the leader we need in the White House to heal our country today, and to unite us once again tomorrow.\"\n\"As a teacher who has worked at a Title I school, I know how revolutionary Vice President Biden's education plan would be for students and teachers,\" said educator Megan Rucker. \"Leaders like Joe understand and appreciate what a new generation of students need – and that by investing in students and their educators early on, and providing better access to mental health support, counselors other critical support systems, we can take our country to new heights. Joe gets what life is like for teachers and students at low-income schools like the kids I teach – but most importantly, he rolls up his sleeves to do something about it. I'm proud to support Joe Biden because Joe Biden supports teachers like me.\"\n\"As a longtime supporter of President Obama's, I'm very proud of the Obama-Biden legacy that ushered in a new era of progress in our country,\" said attorney and community activist Patrick Riley. \"President Obama counted on Vice President Biden to help him lead then, and Joe Biden has my full faith and confidence now to hit the ground running on Day One to make the strides on reducing climate change we need, to build on – not end – the Affordable Care Act, and to end gun violence across this country.\"\n\"Meeting Vice President Biden, you get to know his heart,\" said veteran and advocate Miyoko Hikiji. \"Joe Biden has seen himself the struggles of the military while deployed, and their battles with the VA system back home. Having served in Iraq, I understand the costs of war. So, it's important to me that our next Commander in Chief will support the Armed Forces, whenever possible, with the most powerful executive action — peace. Diplomacy and development protect soldiers abroad and secure our nation's soil by promoting the values, economic interests and moral leadership that other countries look to. Our next president must understand, and rebuild, America's role in the world. Joe Biden can champion the restoration of our nation's reputation because he's a leader who listens to, cares for, and respects the sacrifices of our troops, and knows his duty to protect our country is a sacred promise. While in uniform, with all that was asked of me, I will not ask for anything less. It's time to make Joe Biden the next President of the United States.\"\n\"I've been fortunate to know Joe Biden for much of my life,\" said community and resource development specialist Ellen Goodmann Miller. \"I was proud to have worked on his Iowa campaign in 2007-2008 and to witness the Vice President's critical leadership during the Obama-Biden Administration. Right now, the U.S. is facing grave challenges. We need Joe's vision to unify our country in order to build a brighter future here at home; and we need his unparalleled leadership to restore our standing in the world. Joe has lived through some of the toughest of times, and I believe he can lead us through the many challenges our country faces with compassion, conviction, and a shared vision of equity, justice, and prosperity for all.\"\n\"As a veteran who served our country proudly, there's no other leader I'd rather see at the helm steering our nation forward and protecting our troops than Joe Biden,\" said Iowa National Guard veteran and community activist Jesse McCunniff. \"He's proven his steady hand at home and abroad from helping bring us from the edge of financial ruin to getting tough on our foreign adversaries to help make our country safer. We need his leadership now to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, to improve – not do away with Obamacare, and to strengthen our education system for our kids. We need a leader – not more petty politics. We need Joe Biden in White House.\"\n",

    "text": "\nDes Moines, Iowa – On the heels of Vice President Joe Biden's four-day trip across Iowa and a powerful speech about the battle for the soul of America, former Iowa State Senate Majority Leader Mike Gronstal announced his endorsement of Biden.\nFormer State Senator Gronstal is a longtime champion for the rights of working Iowans and access to quality, affordable health care. As State Senate Majority leader in 2009, he delivered a significant victory for LGBTQ Iowans by successfully blocking a Republican-led effort to discriminate against same-sex marriage through a constitutional amendment. In his endorsement of Vice President Biden, Gronstal cited the similar courage Biden has consistently demonstrated in standing up for the dignity of every American.\n\"Iowans need leadership that has the backbone to stand up for the civil rights of all Americans – that's our proud legacy and it's Joe Biden's, too,\" said former Iowa State Senate Majority Leader Mike Gronstal. \"When I was Iowa Senate Majority Leader, I halted Republican attempts to discriminate against LGBTQ Iowans. That wasn't necessarily a popular position back then – and when Joe Biden took a stand in support of the freedom to marry it wasn't without risk, either. But in Iowa, we value our principles above politics – and that's who Joe Biden has always been.\n\"A longtime friend to our family, Joe is always among the first to call and offer words of comfort and support in times of hardship or loss. Joe connects so well with Iowa families like mine because he knows what hardship and struggle for working people really means – he's lived it – and he's spent a lifetime fighting for their interests. As president, Joe would help restore the dignity working people deserve – from making sure Iowans have the training for jobs of today and tomorrow to fighting to make sure every family has access to affordable, quality health care they can depend on. I'm proud to support Joe Biden for President of the United States because he's the right person to restore decency, humanity, and respect to the White House.\"\nGronstal's wife, community leader and retired social worker Connie Gronstal, also endorsed Vice President Biden last month, citing his advocacy for children and families.\n\"Few leaders exemplify the tenacity and courage it takes to stand up for all Iowans more than Iowa Senate Majority Leader Mike Gronstal,\" said Jake Braun, Iowa State Director, Biden for President. \"As a lifelong champion of working people and opportunities they deserve, Gronstal also took an early stand for LGBTQ rights when they were being constitutionally threatened in the Iowa State Legislature. Gronstal knows Vice President Biden's heart and supports Joe Biden's vision for the future of this country because it's one that will fight for the dignity that every Iowa worker and family deserves.\"\n",

That's why in congress I have fought for investment in education, healthcare, and infrastructure in order to afford others the same opportunities I had.

These local leaders are passionate about a future for this country that restores the dignity our students, agricultural industry, and communities deserve – and that's why they're committed to fighting for Vice President Biden's campaign to win back the White House.\"\nToday's endorsements include:\n\nDick Myers, Former Iowa House Democratic Leader (Iowa City)\nDenise Dolan, Dubuque County Auditor (Dubuque)\nGary Anhalt, Retired Educator, Current School Board Member and Lifetime National Education Association Member(Cedar Rapids)\nLisa Heddens, Story County Supervisor (Ames)\nBob Kling, Indianola City Councilman (Indianola)\nKevin Middleswart, Former Warren County Supervisor (Indianola)\nSara Riley, Attorney and Democratic Activist (Cedar Rapids)\nNancy Riley, Linn County Democratic Activist (Cedar Rapids)\n\nIn endorsing Vice President Biden, leaders from Iowa City, Dubuque, Cedar Rapids, Ames and Indianola said the following:\n\"Agriculture is the backbone industry in our state, employing countless Iowans. From farmers to manufacturing workers, no one has been hit harder by the policies of the current administration,\" said Former Iowa State House Democratic Minority Leader Dick Myers. \"The trade war has done irreparable harm to our ag industry, and there's only one person who knows how to fix it – that's Joe Biden. Under his leadership as Vice President, and that of Secretary Vilsack, Iowa did well. Ande, Joe Biden will be able to take the helm to restore the respect and stability agriculture deserves. That's why I am proud to support Joe Biden for President.\"\n\"Iowans expect and deserve leadership that upholds our values of mutual respect and empathy for our neighbors – that's who Joe Biden is, and it's who he's always been,\" said Dubuque County Auditor Denise Dolan. \"As Vice President, Joe Biden proved he can get tough on our adversaries while maintaining respect for the United States around the world. I've supported Vice President Biden for many years and his commitment to equality and social justice is unmatched. I'm proud of my continued support for Joe Biden and I'm excited to endorse him for President.\"\n\"As a longtime educator who taught K-6 for almost 40 years in the Cedar Rapids public school system, it's critical to me that our kids have a president with the character and integrity they can look up to, and who can rebuild relationships across the globe,\" said retired educator, current School Board Member and Lifetime National Education Association Member Gary Anhalt. \"That's who Joe Biden is, and his commitment, if elected president, to making sure teachers have a seat at the table when it comes to our education policy by appointing an educator as Secretary of Education is exactly what our country needs.\"\n\"If there's one person who is most prepared to step into the presidency, it's Vice President Joe Biden,\" said Story County Supervisor Lisa Heddens. \"He has built relationships with world leaders and he has the gravitas needed to negotiate agreements. Through his years of experience, Vice President Biden has built up the trust necessary to get deals done with both parties to help the American people. He worked to pass the historic Affordable Care Act and he understands that people need access to both physical and mental health services. Joe Biden is a man of integrity and a person I trust to lead our country out of the challenges we are currently facing and lead us forward.\"\n\"I've spent over 34 years teaching at public schools in Iowa and another 16 teaching at Simpson College,\" said Indianola City Councilman Bob Kling. \"I know the value of a good education and the benefits that come from a well-educated society. We need a President who also understands those values, and the person for the job is Joe Biden. He has the experience and ability that we need to put the country back on the right path. He is the stabilizing force the world needs now more than ever. The thought of Joe Biden as President warms my heart and I'm fully confident in his ability to win.\"\n\"I've personally known Joe Biden for thirty years and he is someone I can count on and trust,\" said Former Warren County Supervisor Kevin Middleswart. \"Since his days in the Senate, he has been a strong supporter of all Iowans. He has the credibility and temperament necessary to negotiate deals both internationally and domestically. Joe Biden would be a president for all Americans, he is the right man to unite the country.\"\n\"There's no question our country and communities have become more divided over the past Administration, and particularly in Iowa, the instability and tension have hit us hard,\" said Sara Riley, Cedar Rapids Attorney and Democratic Activist. \"We need leadership that doesn't just understand how to repair relationships around the world, but who has actually done the job. That's the leadership Vice President Biden brings to the table, and it's the heart he would bring to the White House.\"\n",

The plan he has put forth is bold and I am confident his administration will not rest until every child, no matter their zip code or the color of their skin, has access to a high quality education. With Joe Biden as president, teachers and students will once again have a true education advocate in the White House.\"\nThe announcement comes on the heels of Joe Biden's two-day swing in the upstate, including Secretary Riley's hometown of Greenville, South Carolina.\n\"Secretary Riley is one of the most influential and beloved political figures in South Carolina whether you are a Democrat or Republican\" says Kendall Corley, South Carolina State Director, Biden for President. \"It is truly an honor to have his support. Secretary Riley embodies the meaning of public service, especially when it comes to education, and he sees that same commitment in Joe Biden.\"\nRiley's endorsement is the 86th for Biden in South Carolina, including 18 state legislators, 10 mayors, 43 faith leaders, and more than a dozen other state and local leaders.

    "text": "\nToday, Biden for President is announcing new endorsements from U.S. Reps. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina, and Charlie Crist of Florida, adding two Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) members and a former governor to the growing list of prominent and influential elected leaders supporting Joe Biden. Rep. Cleaver chaired the CBC from 2011-2013, Rep. Butterfield chaired the CBC from 2015-2017, and Rep. Crist served as the governor of Florida from 2007 to 2011.\nVice President Biden has earned four total congressional endorsements this week, including Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of Texas, a Congressional Hispanic Caucus member who recently switched his endorsement to Vice President Biden after the third Democratic presidential debate.\nThese Congressional endorsements represent the broad and diverse coalition Vice President Biden is building in states across the country. The representatives outline below why Joe Biden represents a sea of change from the current president and will fight to restore and strengthen our democracy.\nU.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri:\"As a pastor, my values, morals, and faith have been a guiding light throughout my life and time in public service. From becoming the first African-American Mayor of Kansas City to becoming a member of Congress, my strong convictions have given me the foundation necessary to fight for jobs, economic development, and housing reform for the people of Missouri. In the same manner, Joe Biden's convictions have led him to fight for what he believes in and to serve not only the people of Delaware but the nation.\n\"Democracy is delicate and susceptible to perversion by the powerful. Over the past three years, we—and the entire world—have witnessed an undisguised assault on our democratic institutions. The man entrusted to faithfully execute the laws of our nation has distorted them to protect his own interests at the expense of the American people. The current administration has led our country into a moral darkness and away from the core values that once made America a respected and dignified leader on the world stage.\n\"The next election is, in many ways, about whether our leader can restore the soul of our nation and re-establish the long held notion that the United States of America is moving welcomingly and indelibly toward a unified nation. Our nation is in dire need of someone like Joe Biden, a leader who has never been afraid to speak out for what he believes is right. Joe Biden has been a champion in fighting for American families for over forty years. And right now, he's speaking out against the divisive rhetoric and abhorrent behavior we continue to see under this president. We need integrity to be restored in the highest office. That's why I proudly endorse Joe Biden for President.\"\nU.S. Rep. G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina:\"My parents taught me that regardless of one's station in life they were entitled to quality health care, a good education, and the tools to succeed. My father and mother not only instilled those same values in me, but they were living examples of great humanitarians.\n\"As a dentist, my father never denied anyone care if they could not afford it. My mother was a teacher who taught elementary school for 48 years in some of the poorest communities in North Carolina. They both served as an inspiration for my life in public service, where I have been a tireless advocate and champion for my constituents.\n\"We need a tireless advocate and champion for this nation in the White House, and that person is Joe Biden. He is immensely prepared to lead our great country. As former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, I have watched Republicans advance legislation that intentionally leaves some communities behind and they deserve better. Civil rights brought Joe Biden into the fight, and I know he'll continue that fight – the fight for equality and the opportunity for economic success. That's why I proudly endorse Joe Biden for President of the United States.\"\nU.S. Rep. and former Governor of Florida Charlie Crist:\"I have had the honor of serving Florida as Attorney General, Governor, and now as a Congressman representing the most beautiful congressional district in the country. Through my time in public service, I have learned that being the voice of the people means rising above partisan white noise to do whatever it takes to get things done. Especially when it means protecting Florida's beautiful coasts, restoring voting rights of non-violent ex-felons, and continuing to lead efforts to protect civil rights.\n\"Joe Biden's record of getting things done speaks for itself. He has always put the American people above party lines and will continue to as President. We currently have a president that has sacrificed the economic livelihood of Americans through government shutdowns, tariffs, and attempts to repeal health care in order to score political points. We need a president whose objective at the end of the day is to move the country forward for everyone through action, not empty promises.\n\"Furthermore, he's the best candidate we can nominate to take on President Trump, growing our big tent party, earning the support of independents and disaffected Republicans — all key to winning Florida and thus closing off Trump's path to re-election.\n\"For these reasons and more, I proudly endorse Joe Biden for President.\"\nLast week, the campaign announced endorsements from 59 African American state legislators, as well as new endorsements from Former U.S. Secretary Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and elected officials and community leaders from South Carolina and New Hampshire and from the Super Tuesday states Texas and Tennessee.\nBiden for President has previously announced more than 410 endorsements from national, state and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, and community leaders, including six endorsements from Congressional Black Caucus members.\n",

    "text": "\n[As prepared for delivery.]\nWhen I announced, I said I was running for President because I believed the core values of our nation — our very democracy — were at risk.\nEvents in recent days have made that clearer than ever.\nWe have a President who believes there is no limit to his power.We have a President who believes he can do anything and get away with it. We have a President who believes he is above the law.\nPressuring the leader of another nation to investigate a political opponent — to help win his election is not the conduct of an American President.\nThe allegation that he blocked hundreds of millions of dollars in Congressionally approved aid to another country unless it agreed to smear his political opponent is not the conduct of an American President.\nDenying Congress the information to which it is constitutionally entitled — and obstructing its efforts to investigate his actions — is not the conduct of an American president.\nIt's an abuse of power. It undermines our national security. It violates the oath of office. And it strikes at the heart of the sworn responsibility the President has to put the national interest before his personal interest.\nI knew when I decided to run this President would attack me and my family. That's what he does.\nAnd I know that even though every reputable publication that has looked at these charges has found them baseless, untrue, and without merit. It won't stop him. I can take the political attacks. They'll come and go and soon be forgotten.\nBut if we allow a President to get away with shredding the United States Constitution — that will last forever.\nToo many people have taken an oath to this nation and given their lives over the past 243 years to let that happen. Too many people are serving this nation right now and honoring the oaths they have taken to let that happen.\nThis isn't a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue.\nIt's time for this administration to stop stonewalling and provide the Congress with all the facts it needs, including a copy of the formal complaint made by the Whistleblower.\nAnd it's time for the Congress to fully investigate the conduct of this President.\nThe President should stop stonewalling this investigation and all the other investigations of his wrongdoing.\nUsing its full Constitutional authority, Congress should demand the information it has a legal right to receive.\nAnd if the President does not comply — if he continues to obstruct Congress and flout the law — Donald Trump will leave Congress no choice but to initiate impeachment.\nThat would be a tragedy. But a tragedy of the president's own making.\nI have always believed that America is a special nation.\nBetter than any nation in history. We have made the experiment in self-governance work.\nWe have always been a beacon to the world.\nWe know who Donald Trump is.\nIt's time to let the world know who we are.\n",

    "text": "\nThe 2,000-word summation of a 30-minute phone call released by the White House makes clear that days after the President ordered the delay of Congressionally-appropriated military assistance to Ukraine, he implored the President of Ukraine to work with his personal attorney to manufacture a smear against a domestic political opponent, using a malicious conspiracy theory that has been universally debunked by every independent outlet that has looked at it.\nWe also learned that he planned to involve the United States Department of Justice in this scheme — a direct attack on the core independence of that department, an independence essential to the rule of law.\nAnd this is all according to the abridged version that the White House was willing to issue to the public. Congress is entitled to the full whistleblower complaint, and any and all other information about this matter.\nIt is a tragedy for this country that our president put personal politics above his sacred oath. He has put his own political interests over our national security interest, which is bolstering Ukraine against Russian pressure. It is an affront to every single American and the founding values of our country. This is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. It is a national security issue. It is a test of our democratic values.\nCongress must pursue the facts and quickly take prompt action to hold Donald Trump accountable.\nIn the meantime, I will continue to focus my campaign not on how Donald Trump abused his power to come after my family, but on how he has turned his back on America's families.\nDonald Trump has failed working people and middle class families in this country by trying to take away their health care, by giving tax cuts to the wealthiest, and by failing to combat the climate crisis head on. Fewer Americans have health care coverage, manufacturing is in a recession, the auto industry is shedding jobs — all due to Donald Trump. He has isolated America on the global stage by attacking our allies and cozying up to dictators.\nThe House must do its job and hold Donald Trump to account for his abuse of power. I must do mine, and remain focused on making my case for a vision of the American presidency that will mean real help for those in our country who need it most.\n",

In a Congress dominated by ideological polarization, we need a President that will deliver real solutions and has that same steadfast dedication to results. The current administration has not only exacerbated the existing divisions in Congress, but has divided the nation with hateful rhetoric and harmful policies — making it impossible for this country to move forward.\n\"I've worked closely with Vice President Biden and I've seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitude. During his time in Congress and in the White House, Joe Biden has been a tireless fighter for hard working American families. By making gun reform one of the pillars of his campaign and policy platform, Joe Biden demonstrates that he clearly recognizes what is needed to keep Americans safe. And I know, as President, he will continue the fight to restore the soul of the nation from the Oval Office.\"\n",

    "text": "\nJohn Steinbeck memorably wrote that, \"A soldier is the most holy of all humans, because [they are] the most tested.\" From Fort McHenry to San Juan Hill, from the Argonne Forest to Midway, from the Mekong Delta to Fallujah, and on every battlefield between, America's veterans have always been the most tested among us — and they have never failed in their duty.\nIn each generation, a small fraction of Americans serve and sacrifice on behalf of us all. Less than one percent of our population risks everything to protect our country, incurring in the rest of us a debt far greater than our nation could ever repay. We have always believed that the most sacred obligation of our government is to do right by the men and women who defend our nation at war — to care for them and their families, both while they are deployed and after they come home. It's an obligation we are honor-bound to keep.\nVeterans Day offers us a moment to reflect on that obligation, and to recommit ourselves to all that it truly means. Every one of our veterans deserves timely, world-class health care — the very best of what our country has to offer. They deserve comprehensive mental health support, and a thoughtful, well-funded plan to address the ongoing tragedy of veteran suicides. They deserve a serious approach to ending veteran homelessness, and greater resources to help them readjust to life at home once their service concludes. Not only do they deserve these things — their families and caregivers do, too.\nOur veterans also deserve a leg up when it comes to educational and economic opportunities — everything from tuition assistance to skills training to entrepreneurship programs. That isn't just for their benefit; America benefits enormously from the leadership, talent, and experience of veterans who gird every sector of our economy with sinew and smarts. The GI Bill was one of the greatest engines of widespread prosperity our country has ever conceived, helping to cement the most resilient middle class in the history of the world in the wake of World War II. Our veterans and our country deserve that commitment to be upheld and advanced.\nMost of all, our veterans deserve leaders who will fight for them as ardently and as forcefully as they have fought for us.\nThat's why, on this Veterans Day, we are proud to release a detailed and comprehensive plan to honor the full breadth of our obligation to veterans and their families — and to restore the sacred commitments that this White House has seen fit to ignore.\nThis plan and this cause are personal to us. Over the course of many years, it has been our honor to visit our troops in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and to witness their incredible strength of character firsthand. We have been blessed to visit with wounded veterans in Landstuhl, Germany, and at the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, and to welcome troops to our home for Thanksgiving dinners and spend many Christmas Days with the heroes at Walter Reed. When our son Beau was deployed to Iraq for a year, we whispered prayers, and learned a small portion of what sacrifice means to the families of those who serve.\nEvery one of the more than 18 million veterans in our country has earned our admiration and our gratitude — but it is our duty to repay them with something more than that. We must honor their service with bold policies that meet our sacred obligation, with opportunities commensurate to the sacrifices they and their families have made, and with trustworthy national leadership.\n",

    "text": "\nJoe Biden believes that as a nation, we have many obligations, but we have only one truly sacred obligation: to properly prepare and equip our troops when we send them into harm's way, and to care for them and their families--both while they are deployed and after they return home. As the parents of a son who deployed to Iraq, Joe and Jill Biden understand the gravity of this promise. Our service members ensure our freedoms, our security, and the very future of our country. They are willing to sacrifice everything. Many do. And each of them deserves our respect and enduring gratitude, both while on active duty and after separating from service.\nPresident Trump has repeatedly failed our veterans and ignored this sacred obligation. From the outrage of deporting undocumented veterans without checking their record of military service, to allowing his wealthy Mar-a-Lago friends to drive veterans policy, to pursuing policies designed to privatize and dismantle the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Trump neither understands nor respects the idea of \"duty, honor, country\" that inspires our brave military members to serve and imbues our veterans with pride.\nLess than one percent of Americans currently serve in the military, and the other 99 percent of us owe them the secure futures they have earned. As president, Joe Biden will keep faith with our veterans and their families. He will meet our sacred obligation.\nThe Biden Record of Delivering for Our Veterans\nJoe Biden has fought aggressively for our service members and veterans throughout his career in public service. His record speaks for itself. On the broad range of issues that matter to our brave military members and our veterans, Joe Biden has always had their back.\nAs a senator, Joe Biden was an early advocate for Vietnam veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange and other toxins to be able to access the care and benefits they deserve.\nHe championed funding for prosthetics for veterans and mammogram coverage for female veterans, fought for proper burial allowances, and supported the concurrent receipt of retirement and disability pay for veterans. He co-sponsored the legislation to establish the Vietnam, Korean, and WWII memorials in Washington, D.C., as well as the post-9/11 GI Bill to provide educational benefits to a new generation of heroes.\nBiden also led the way in the Senate on critical issues to protect the health of our military, most notably driving the fight to increase funding for up-armored Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles (MRAPs) by $23.6 billion, which saved thousands of lives and limbs of U.S. service members in Iraq and Afghanistan. And he introduced legislation to prohibit cuts to military medical care during times of war.\nIn the White House, Biden continued to be a clarion voice advocating for our veterans. The Obama-Biden Administration accomplished major milestones, including cutting the population of homeless veterans by almost half and reducing the unemployment rate for veterans by more than half. In 2013, when an unacceptable backlog of veterans' disability claims was uncovered at the VA, the Obama-Biden Administration took aggressive action to rectify the failures and ultimately reduced the backlog by nearly 90 percent in just over three years. The Obama-Biden Administration also increased the overall funding request for the VA by more than 85 percent during its years in office, including a 76 percent increase in funding devoted to the critical issue of veterans' mental health. It successfully implemented the new GI Bill and approved the long overdue expansion of benefits to those suffering from Agent Orange-related conditions.\nDuring the Obama-Biden Administration, the VA also led in creating the Blue Button app to help veterans access their health data and medical records more easily. Today, Blue Button is used by more than 2 million veterans.\nAdditionally, Dr. Jill Biden and First Lady Michelle Obama created and led the Joining Forces initiative to build support for our veterans and military families, including a focus on increasing employment opportunities. Between April 2011 and the end of the Administration, Joining Forces supported programs and secured commitments from employers that led to the hiring or training of more than 1.5 million veterans and military spouses.\nOur longest wars have taken their toll, both on our newest generation of veterans and on the system built to support them and previous generations of veterans. According to the most recent census data, there are more than 18 million veterans in the United States, and today's veterans population has needs that the VA has never before addressed. This is reflected both in the growing interest for \"anywhere, anytime\" health care service models and in our growing understanding of behavioral health challenges, the harmful impacts of burn pits, environmental toxins, traumatic brain injury, and the devastating epidemic of opioid addiction and suicide. The VA must adapt to meet the ever-evolving needs of the veteran community.\nAt the same time, the VA continues to struggle with poor organizational performance, staff shortfalls, leadership gaps, and IT systems failures. The integration of a new generation of veterans into the VA system has added a substantial number of veterans eligible for health care and other benefits as overall demand for services has surged, with the combination creating capacity challenges across the system. Too often, the VA's performance in terms of access, outcomes, cost, and accountability is mixed. There have been both important successes and intolerable failures or gaps in service. Solving these challenges will require a substantial investment in talent, leadership time, budget, and public attention. It's what we owe our veterans. It is past time to rethink and reinvent a better VA.\nThere is nothing partisan about improving support for service members, veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors. As president, Joe Biden will unite the country and restore the VA as the premier agency for ensuring our veterans' overall well-being by:\n\nProviding Veterans World Class Health Care to Meet Their Specific Needs\nDriving Progress to Eliminate Veterans Homelessness and Bring Down Suicide Rates\nCreating Meaningful Employment and Educational Opportunities\nImproving VA Management and Accountability.\n\nTo support the VA mission, a Biden Administration will ensure coordination with the Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), state agencies, and the thousands of non-governmental organizations that support this vital community. It will work faithfully to restore public trust in the VA so that no one in the military community or beyond will ever again question whether the United States of America keeps its promises to those who serve our country.\nProviding Veterans World Class Health Care to Meet Their Specific Needs\nThe Veterans Health Administration serves upwards of 9 million veterans and is responsible for their whole health, physical and mental. Studies have found that health outcomes at VA hospitals are often better than their non-VA counterpart, and more than 90 percent of those who receive their health services through the VA report that they would recommend it to a fellow veteran. As president, Joe Biden will work to ensure that the VA provides the world class health care that our veterans have earned and deserve and sets the example for private sector care.\nIn the area of mental health, the VA and DoD have done pioneering work to address the specific needs of veterans, deploying innovative treatment solutions such as telehealth and other platforms to address a variety of conditions. The private sector trails the VA in its ability to provide behavioral health services to the nation as a whole, much less to understand the unique needs of veterans.\nAt the same time, the VA is also struggling with a rapidly deteriorating infrastructure, and many VA facilities are more than 60 years old. Further, across the system, the variance in quality of — and access to — care is unacceptable. As the demand for treatment has increased, the VA must continually strive to improve services and outcomes for veterans, especially in the areas of pain, polytrauma recovery, substance-use disorder (SUD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and general behavioral health, in the most effective and cost-efficient way possible.\nIn addition to protecting and building on the Affordable Care Act with a public option to expand access to quality, affordable health care and lower costs, and commitments to keep rural hospitals open and expand health care delivery models for rural areas, a Biden Administration will:\n\nRebuild trust in the Department of Veterans Affairs. During the Obama-Biden Administration, we improved access to health care offerings for veterans in their communities, but there is still more work to do. Private sector points of care were designed to provide care to veterans when it was faster, closer, or offered superior services for a particular veteran's needs. We must ensure that health care purchased in the community actually improves access and convenience and does not compromise the health of our veterans. President Biden will establish the right balance of VA care and purchased care, region by region, based on veteran needs, existing VA capacity, and availability of market alternatives.\nConduct a thorough assessment of the staffing needs and requirements across the VA to inform specific hiring initiatives and programs for attracting and retaining medical professionals. This includes ensuring that professionals are working to the full scope of their license and creating incentives to support health care professionals joining the VA workforce.\nRefine and update Community Care Guidelines, ensuring that if a veteran is referred to a community care provider that does not meet the same level of access and quality as the VA, the veteran will be referred back to the VA. This full-circle referral process will better ensure that veterans are seen in a timely manner and receive the best possible quality of care.\nEstablish cultural competency training protocols to ensure that providers in VA facilities and in community care settings understand and are equipped to support the needs of LGBTQ veterans in the health care setting.\nWork with Congress to improve health services for women veterans. Biden will ensure that each VA Medical Center has at least one full-time women's primary care physician; and, within 200 days of taking office, make available a women veterans training module for community health care providers. And, Biden will work with Congress to enact the Deborah Sampson Act and ensure that the safety and privacy concerns of women veterans are addressed throughout his Administration.\nProvide funding to ensure there is safe, reliable child care at all VA Medical Centers.\nWork with Congress to eliminate co-pays for preventive health care for veterans, which can create unnecessary barriers to seeking basic preventive care.\nExpand the list of presumptive conditions to ensure no veteran who experienced a TBI or had exposure to burn pits or other environmental toxins goes without access to VA health care and benefits. We cannot ask our veterans who are suffering to wait decades, as we did with Agent Orange. President Biden will also increase access to VA care beyond the 5-year eligibility window for combat veterans, as conditions related to toxic exposure may take many years to manifest.\nIncrease research dollars by $300 million to invest in better understanding the impact of TBI and toxic exposures (including burn pits) on long-term health outcomes, and continue to drive research focused on the needs of disabled veterans.\nEnsure that disabled veterans that require a prosthesis are able to access the most modern prosthetics technology available, and that they are able to upgrade their equipment at no cost as new developments occur.\nExpand funding for direct and purchase-care treatment for disorders related to the misuse of alcohol and opioids in order to reduce unacceptably long wait-times for treatment.\nA Biden Administration will support the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes and reschedule cannabis as a schedule II drug so researchers can study its positive and negative impacts. This will include allowing the VA to research the use of medical cannabis to treat veteran-specific health needs.\nEnsure the full integration of veteran caregivers as members of the health care team for veterans. The VA offers a diverse array of programs and supports for caregivers, however, we must ensure that the VA remains a caregiver-friendly environment and respects their role in ensuring the recovery and rehabilitation of their loved one.\nIncrease funding for and expand access to telehealth through the VA, particularly in rural areas not able to access timely care.\nModernize VA hospitals and clinics to serve our veterans better through a nationwide infrastructure plan that provides a comprehensive refresh of VA health facilities. Biden will retrofit VA's existing brick and mortar physical locations, where patient volume warrants, and repurpose older facilities to meet new needs such as assisted-living facilities and long-term care alternatives. Biden will improve both the buildings and equipment, so the VA continues to lead in providing 21st century care.\nCreate safe, modern, clean, and recovery-oriented housing for veterans being treated for SUDs and those who are homeless by refurbishing buildings condemned or not in use, such as the massive VA Los Angeles campus.\n\nDriving Progress to Promote Veterans' Mental Health and Well-Being\nSuicide is a public health crisis--the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. As a society, we need to work together to eliminate the stigma felt by those who are suffering and struggling with their mental health. There is no shame in asking for help. As president, Joe Biden will increase access to mental health treatment by enforcing full mental health parity and ensuring all Americans have access to high-quality mental health care, regardless of their insurance coverage status. Service members and veterans are at an elevated risk of dying by suicide. Recent data show that, on average, 20 veterans and service members die by suicide every day, and among some groups, the rate of suicide is rising alarmingly. Even one death by suicide is devastating, and we must do more to stem the tide. The Trump administration has grossly mismanaged this crisis, at one point leaving millions of VA dollars dedicated to suicide prevention efforts unused, and that's just not right. This is a serious challenge, and our goal must be to remove the stigma in military communities to seek help, ensure that every veteran that reaches out is immediately connected to support and services, and to ultimately end the suicide crisis among veterans. As president, Biden will ensure a multi-faceted, substantive, and sustained commitment that addresses this as the public health emergency that it is.\nThe same is true when it comes to veterans experiencing homelessness. The Obama-Biden Administration proved that we can make huge inroads to address this persistent challenge with sustained attention and cross-coordination among government departments. But with just over 23,000 veterans without shelter on any given night, we have much more work to do.\nA Biden Administration will:\n\nPublish within the first 200 days in office a comprehensive public health and cross-sector approach to addressing suicide in veterans, service members, and their families.\nWork aggressively to facilitate immediate access to mental health services for veterans in crisis, to include standardizing performance expectations around same day, walk-in and urgent mental health services; hiring more ER psychiatric staff and peer specialists; expanding crisis line capacity to ensure all calls are answered and appropriate referrals occur within hours; and implementing specific programs to encourage veterans to prioritize their mental health by reaching out to the VA when they need support. Within the first year in office, President Biden will have a goal of completely eliminating wait times for veterans who reach out with suicidal ideation so that they are immediately taken into treatment.\nTogether with states, community-based organizations, and employers, implement public education and outreach initiatives to help veterans understand that care is available and effective. We must work to end the culture of silence around mental health issues and remove the stigma associated with getting mental health treatment, particularly among service members who are more used to helping others than asking for it themselves.\nEnsure the DoD's Suicide Prevention Office and the VA have the resources and staff they need to make smart investments with allocated funds--and that money dedicated to suicide prevention efforts never goes unused.\nCreate a national center of excellence for reducing veteran suicide, similar to the National Center on Homelessness among Veterans. Biden will recruit top-level leadership to build strategic partnerships and solutions that extend beyond the VA's health care system.\nRequire all providers of veterans services funded by the VA to receive training on suicide risk identification and safety planning, to include lethal means restriction and appropriate response and reporting about suicide.\nEnact policies that promote the value and dignity of life by supporting programs that increase economic stability; promote connectedness through structured social support; and reduce risky behaviors, such as substance use, poor sleep, and improper firearm storage.\nExpand capacity at Vet Centers to ensure veterans in communities can access readjustment counseling services and resources, including financial and long-term planning. President Biden will specifically expand outreach and resources for veterans as they experience periods of transition, not just out of the military, but throughout their life, including into post-career retirement.\nTackle issues that contribute to higher suicide risk. This includes implementing programs to disseminate high-quality treatments for PTSD, ensuring that veterans have access to the best treatments available no matter where they receive care, and instituting policies that seek to eliminate discrimination, end harassment and hold perpetuators of sexual assault in the military accountable. A Biden Administration will not tolerate the sexual assault culture that has become all too common in the military and veteran sector.\nWork with Congress to continue to drive down veteran homelessness by permanently authorizing the Supportive Services for Veterans Families (SSVF) program, which provides critical funding for wrap-around services for those facing homelessness. President Biden will also work to ensure that we better understand the unique needs of women and LGBTQ veterans experiencing homelessness.\nReform the policy and review processes for veterans so that less-than-honorable discharges will not be unjustly awarded for conduct directly linked to the behavioral health effects of PTSD, TBI, or other trauma experienced while serving.\n\nCreating Civilian Lives of Meaning and Opportunity\nThe Obama-Biden Administration worked tirelessly to bring down high unemployment levels among our veterans. Over the course of 8 years, the Obama-Biden administration cut the veteran unemployment rate by more than half. That is vitally important progress, but now, we have to think about empowering our veterans and their future employers with the tools they need to build pathways to successful, long-term careers. Recent data indicate that veterans are more likely than their civilian counterparts to take a job at lower skill-level. As president, Biden will keep his foot on the gas to ensure that service members transitioning back to civilian lives have the best opportunities to succeed and build fulfilling futures.\nA Biden Administration will:\n\nWork closely with DoD to ensure that the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) is implemented effectively and that outcomes are regularly reported.\nEnsure that more transitioning service members are able to access job training and placement services prior to their end of active duty service. By expanding private sector relationships through programs like the SkillBridge program, Biden will give qualified transitioning service members the opportunity to start building a meaningful civilian career as early as possible.\nWork with the Department of Labor to enforce the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA) hiring benchmark among federal contractors and subcontractors, and provide preferences and incentives to corporations that meet the benchmark.\nPromote corporate mentorship programs between veteran-owned businesses and existing contractors to support veteran entrepreneurship.\nEnsure careful implementation of the Forever GI Bill so that veterans receive the educational benefits they have earned on time.\nImplement annual reporting to be led by the VA in partnership with the Department of Education and promote interagency cooperation and data sharing to better understand academic outcomes for all GI Bill users.\nDevelop best-practice guidelines for supporting veterans in higher education to assist higher education institutions to improve graduation rates among GI Bill recipients and provide financial incentivizes for campuses that follow guidelines and transparently report their outcomes.\nWork aggressively to close the 90/10 loophole on GI Bill and Tuition Assistance dollars to keep for-profit bad actors from raiding the benefits service members and veterans have earned.\nSupport and protect post-9/11 GI benefits for veterans and qualified family members by strengthening the GI Bill Comparison Tool and School Feedback Tool to put an end to post-secondary institutions' predatory practices.\nProtect undocumented members of our armed services, veterans, and their spouses from deportation, because if you are willing to risk your life for this country, you and your family have earned the chance to live safe, healthy, and productive lives in America.\nWork with DoD and the Department of Homeland Security to provide timely naturalization for those who have served honorably in our military, with an earned path to citizenship prior to discharge or retirement.\n\nImproving VA Management and Accountability\nThe agency charged with meeting the needs of our veterans--not only their health care needs, but administering their full range of benefits and overseeing the cemeteries that guard their honor in death--should not be limited by outdated management tools and practices. Our veterans deserve the best services available. As president, Biden will enhance the capacity of the VA to serve our veterans as efficiently as possible by overseeing a generational upgrade to clinical and management systems, by leveraging commercial best-practices and modern technologies to meet the unique demands of public sector mission.\nA Biden Administration will:\n\nImprove health care access, quality, and customer experience by seamlessly augmenting direct care with purchase care enabled under the Mission Act. Enhance the administrative, financial, and operational systems that underpin the provision of care in the network model by improving vital case management systems, quality oversight, integrative health treatments and supporting administrative, financial and IT systems. These reforms will help ensure access to high-quality care and a first-rate customer experience that satisfies all veterans, regardless of where they receive care.\nCreate standards of health record interoperability that ensure a comprehensive health record is provided by community care organizations back to the VA.\nInvest in improving human resource and management practices across the VA to strengthen the customer experience for our veterans and deliver services more efficiently. This will include a focus on workforce training and cultivating a culture across the VA that places a premium on quality and service.\nLeverage options under the Mission Act to pilot alternative payment models and prioritize care models that improve the quality of care, not just the volume of services. Veterans should be able to access care in a way that works best for them, not the way that is most convenient for the system, in particular when it comes to meeting specific needs such as rehabilitation services, SUD, and behavioral health.\nReduce delays and errors in claims processing and in scheduling the medical exams necessary for veterans to complete their disability claims. This has been a constant source of frustration for veterans. The long delays in the system, and rates of error — in both Regional Offices and the Board of Veterans' Appeals — are too long and too high, and unfairly delay adjudication of veterans claims. A Biden VA will identify the sources of the problem and undertake the investments in personnel and training needed to ensure that veterans receive accurate decisions in a more timely manner.\nHelp more veterans gain access to their own health data and medical records through the Blue Button app. Blue Button has been downloaded by more than 2 million veterans and is increasingly being used by Medicare beneficiaries and the private sector. By making Blue Button easier to use, the VA will continue to lead the movement of patient-centered models of care.\nImplement a VA-hosted health record that can serve any and every American who wants one. We can leverage Blue Button to access health information no matter where it is, to allow veterans and citizens to manage and use it as they see fit. By putting our veterans first, we can make the VA the nexus of the best care everywhere.\nCreate a national health database for non-profit research scientists and the commercial sector that would accelerate discovery of the best therapies against the devastating diseases of our time: cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's, and dementia. Biden will direct the VA to support the database using its infrastructure, making access available to all. Veterans will be able to choose, on an individual basis, whether or not to contribute their data. This national repository for longitudinal health data will enable us to use technological innovations to see patterns that people don't easily recognize and make connections we don't normally make for the U.S. population as a whole.\n\n",

    "text": "\nAs parents of a service member who deployed to Iraq, Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden understand that it's not just military members who sign up to serve our nation, their families do too. The Bidens understand the sleepless nights, wondering if your deployed loved one is safe; the difficulties children experience while their parent is serving far away; and all the added sacrifices and challenges, big and small, military families face because they choose selfless service. Our military families never fail to give their best to the United States, and we owe them our best in return.\nLess than one percent of Americans sign up to serve. They volunteer to shoulder the sacrifices necessary to keep our country safe. That's why Vice President Biden has long been adamant that, as a nation, our one truly sacred obligation is to properly prepare and equip our troops when we send them to war, and to take care of them and their families — during deployments and when they return home.\nBuilding on the Biden Commitment to Military Families\nThe Obama-Biden Administration made support for our military families a signature issue--and a personal priority. Together with First Lady Michelle Obama, Dr. Biden created Joining Forces, a national initiative driving top-level focus on the issues that matter to military families, service members, and veterans including employment, education, and wellness. Joining Forces supported opportunities that led to the hiring or training of more than 1.5 million veterans and military spouses and drove reforms in all 50 states to reduce credentialing barriers for qualified military spouses seeking employment. Dr. Biden also supported the Department of Defense's (DoD's) Military Spouse Employment Partnership, which brought together hundreds of companies to help 100,000 military spouses find jobs.\nAs a life-long educator, Dr. Biden spearheaded \"Educate the Educators\"--a commitment from more than 100 colleges and universities to take steps to meet the unique needs of military-connected children--and championed the GI Comparison tool to help veterans and military family members choose high-quality post-secondary educational institutions. She also worked to make sure that all 50 states signed the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children to better address relocation challenges facing military school-aged children.\nVice President Biden and Dr. Biden continued this commitment after leaving office, making support for military families a key focus of their continued public service. The Biden Foundation sought to drive economic opportunity for military spouses, create supportive educational environments for military-connected children, and change the conversation around mental health for service members, veterans, and their families.\nAs President and First Lady, the Bidens will ensure we keep our national commitment to military families by relaunching and strengthening Joining Forces, making it a priority for a Biden Administration.\nWe know that many future service members come from military families. So family readiness is integral to mission readiness, both now and in the future. This cannot be an afterthought. It is a national security imperative, and it should be resourced and supported as such.\nThrough nearly two decades of sustained warfare, military families have met many challenges and sacrificed much for our country. They have answered the call to duty again and again. To sustain the world's finest fighting force, Biden will ensure that families on the homefront receive our full support and the benefits they have earned and deserve through:\n\nPaying Service Members a Competitive Wage\nProviding Resources for Military Spouses, Caregivers, and Survivors\nPrioritizing Support for Military Children\n\nPresident Biden will inspire a future generation of Americans to volunteer for military service by ensuring we fulfill our obligations to the generations who have already answered the call to serve our country and by supporting the well-being of ALL military families.\nModernize Compensation to Keep Pace with the Current Economy: Today, more military families are struggling to make ends meet, and some report food insecurity, lack of quality childcare, and poor financial health. That is totally unacceptable. Military service members and their families risk everything for our country--they must be guaranteed a living wage. But the existing compensation framework simply does not allow military families--especially those who are young and more vulnerable--to thrive in today's modern economy. President Biden will work aggressively to update the federal workforce compensation framework for service members so that the government leads the way in ensuring hard-working families can attain a middle class life, and he will support legislation which will, in the meantime, provide an additional allowance for military families living below the poverty line.\nCreate Stability by Increasing Time between Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Moves: Every year, more than 400,000 Permanent Change of Station (PCS) moves occur for service members and their families. This system is expensive, and it is broken. Military families consider frequent relocation as a driver for negative outcomes in career opportunities for military spouses, military child education, and the development of supportive social networks. While every service member and family understands that mission is paramount, we must invest in solutions that build stability for families and set conditions for service member retention and military family well-being.\nAs president, Biden will commission research and develop solutions to support the increase of time between PCS moves while ensuring we meet targets for Operational and Personnel Tempo in order to meet our national security demands. This will require that we comprehensively examine the potential positive and negative impacts of any changes to deployment cycles, unit assignment policies, and force size calculations. One such solution could be investing in the creation of virtual or hybrid learning scenarios for mandatory Professional Military Education (PME) so that service members and their families can remain in place, rather than PCS to a new base for a short educational tour.\nEnsure Military Spouse Professional and Economic Opportunity: Military spouses are often more highly educated than their civilian peers, yet they face an unemployment rate of around 30%. Frequent relocation and high operational tempos often stifle their career trajectory. The military personnel system was designed with the single-earner family in mind, but many military families, like their civilian counterparts, depend on earning a second income or simply want the opportunity for the military spouse to pursue a career. Military families are increasingly experiencing challenges such as food insecurity or insufficient savings for emergencies, and with far too many military spouses unemployed or underemployed, meeting these needs is a challenge. LGBTQ military spouses may also be disproportionately affected when they reside in states that are allowed to discriminate based on an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity. The Trump Administration has not only allowed but encouraged these discriminatory practices, all while claiming to support the military. It's hypocritical and just plain wrong.\nTo increase economic opportunity for military spouses, President Biden will:\n\nInvest $500 million in a 3-year Department of Defense (DOD) military spouse entrepreneurship pilot program, which will provide micro-grants, mentorship, and technical assistance to military spouses who are interested in starting or growing small businesses.\nEnsure that the DoD's Military Spouse Education and Career Opportunity office is fully funded and staffed so that effective programming such as the Military Spouse Employment Partnership (MSEP), My Career Advancement Account (MyCAA) scholarships, and the Military Spouse Transition Program (MySTeP) have the opportunity to deliver results and raise awareness and utilization among military families.\nBuild bridges between the private sector and the U.S. government to help educate employers about the value of military spouse talent, drive commitments to hire, retain, and promote them, and create concrete career opportunities, as Joining Forces did.\nExpand the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) to include military spouses.\nUndo the Trump administration's discriminatory policies and redouble efforts with state officials to ensure that LGBTQ military spouses have the support they need to pursue successful careers.\nContinue efforts begun during the Obama-Biden Administration to put an end to unnecessary occupational licensing requirements. While licensing is important in some occupations to protect consumers, in many occupations licensing does nothing but thwart economic opportunity. If a military spouse who works in an occupation that requires a license or credential and has to move because of their military member's career, they may have to get certified all over again. As president, Biden will build on the Obama-Biden Administration's efforts to incentivize states to reduce unnecessary licensing requirements and to ensure licenses are transferable from one state to the next.\nFully fund installation-based child care facilities and expand awareness of the DoD fee assistance program, as supported by leading advocates for military families,, so that military spouses can more easily pursue their educations and careers and tap into respite care to relieve stressors of deployments.\n\nImprove Support for Caregivers: Caregivers of wounded, ill, or injured service members and veterans face a variety of challenges, including negative health outcomes, lost wages, and difficulties planning their future. They are essential to military families and our veterans, and we owe them the same commitment and support that they show to our wounded, ill, or injured service members and veterans.\nAs president, Biden will:\n\nEnsure that caregivers of active duty service members receive adequate professional and peer support, including competent mental health care, financial readiness training, and transition support throughout the rehabilitation timeline (whether that is leading to the service member's medical retirement or a return to duty).\nProvide transparency and high-touch case management via in-person or telehealth sessions with caregiver coordinators for those caregivers enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Caregiver Support Program, especially to provide personalized assistance as they navigate dual eligibility for benefits and services from both the DoD and VA.\nA critical part of meeting our commitment to military families is to do so on time, something the Trump Administration has failed to do. President Biden will ensure that the eligibility expansion for the VA Caregiver Support Program meets its timelines and collects longitudinal satisfaction data through regular surveying of those enrolled or enrolling in the program.\nHelp caregivers of wounded, ill, injured, or elderly veterans pay for long-term care by providing relief through the creation of a $5,000 tax credit for informal caregivers, modeled off of legislation supported by AARP. This tax credit will be in addition to the financial support provided by the VA Caregiver program.\nSupport proposals to expand opportunities for much needed respite care for caregivers, to include those offered within DoD, VA, and through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\nInstitute a waiver for the Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance Program (Chapter 35), so that spouses and survivors who have not accessed their benefits in the allotted time frame will have the opportunity to request additional time.\n\nEnd Needless Financial Burdens Facing Survivors: As President, Joe Biden will end the needless financial burdens caused by the Survivor Benefit Plan/Dependency Indemnity Compensation Offset (SBP/DIC Offset) or \"Widow's Tax.\" It is wrong that we punish the families of the fallen financially in the wake of their extreme sacrifice.\nImprove Military Child Education: There are more than 1 million children of active duty service members worldwide. Whether they are educated in Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools, local school districts, parochial schools, home schools, or online schools, military children require support to ensure they have every opportunity to succeed in their education.\nAs president, Biden will:\n\nPropose legislation to expand the Military Student Identifier (MSI) to all military-connected children (to include children of National Guard and Reserve personnel regardless of activation/order status), children of veterans, and children of deceased service members or veterans, who are often impacted by the service of their parents. Under the Obama-Biden Administration, we passed into law the Every Student Succeeds Act, which included the MSI, a designation that allows educators and schools to better understand where military-connected children are receiving their education, and how we can better support them. Currently, the MSI extends only to children of active duty service members, excluding children of National Guard, Reserve, veterans, caregivers, and children of the fallen. But these children face unique challenges too, and we need to know who they are so we can determine what support they need .\nPromote efforts across states to streamline enrollment requirements, standardize educational resources, and train teachers and school-based leadership to ensure we are meeting the unique needs of military children effectively, no matter where they study or how often they have to move.\nPromote greater awareness of the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children among military families, teachers, and administrators.\nCreate and disseminate training tools that empower military-connected parents to better advocate for their children.\nProvide financial incentives for school districts to train educators on the unique needs and barriers faced by military-connected youth so that they are able to help military children thrive, no matter where they receive their education.\nSupport and protect post-9/11 GI benefits for veterans and qualified family members by strengthening the GI Bill Comparison Tool and School Feedback Tool to help put an end to post-secondary institutions' predatory practices.\nEnact legislation eliminating the so-called 90/10 loophole that gives for-profit schools an incentive to enroll veterans, service members, and military family members who are using the GI Bill or Tuition Assistance in programs that aren't delivering results.\n\nExpand and Improve Behavioral Health Services for Military Dependents: Children and spouses in military families are resilient, but they do experience high levels of stress, whether due to frequent moves, deployment and training schedules of the service member, or weak social/emotional support networks. School-age children and adolescents who experience separation from a parent (either through deployment or other assignments) show higher levels of emotional and behavioral distress. About 25 percent of high school freshmen and juniors in a military family have reported suicidal thoughts during the previous year, and the stresses of military life can exacerbate health issues, among them depression, anxiety, or substance use disorders.\nBiden has committed to achieving mental health parity, expanding access to behavioral health care, and removing the stigma surrounding behavioral health issues. He will redouble our efforts to ensure enforcement of mental health parity laws and expand funding for mental health services.\nIt is also essential that we invest in an infrastructure that promotes health and well-being, reduces risky behaviors, and provides timely, convenient access to high-quality mental health and substance use/abuse services for military dependents. We must ensure that DoD facilities are fully staffed, equipped, resourced, and able to support the behavioral health of military dependents. If this capacity is not in place, we must invest in solutions to create additional affordable, accessible, and high-quality capacity in the civilian sector. Care must be effective and grounded in evidence-based treatments. Providers must be culturally competent, educated in the unique needs of military families. And families who seek support should never go into debt for treatment or be concerned about confidentiality.\nThe Biden Administration will:\n\nIncrease funding for and expand access to telehealth for military families, particularly in areas not able to access timely care.\nExpand the number of free, non-medical Military OneSource counseling sessions for military families from 12 sessions to 18 and expand access to Coast Guard families regardless of activation status.\nInvest in recruiting and retaining behavioral health care professionals in military treatment facilities to ensure there are enough clinicians to support the needs of not only our active duty force, but military dependents.\nRedefine the federal \"Health Professional Shortage Areas\" (HPSAs) to specifically include military-impacted geographies.\nExpand the National Health Services Corps to incentivize early professional behavioral health providers to serve this population.\nRe-prioritize and expand the work of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) interagency task force on the behavioral health needs of veterans and military families, to include issues related to traumatic brain injury, substance use disorder and addiction, and other related conditions. Additionally, President Biden will fully restore SAMHSA's focus on evidence-based solutions and appoint a specific position on the Domestic Policy Council to drive a whole-of-government focus on these issues.\nDirect the Department of Defense to produce a robust, annual report on the state of military family behavioral health, in coordination with VA and SAMHSA.\n\nGuarantee Safe Housing: The government has broken its trust with military families by providing sub-par housing. Now, we have to work twice as hard to rebuild this trust. That will require the utmost transparency and accountability from both the government and the private sector partners charged with housing the families of our service members.\nThe Biden Administration will:\n\nEnforce a comprehensive and standardized tenant bill of rights for all military families, and as advocates have rightly demanded, ensure DoD senior leadership enforces compliance. We won't be making more empty promises to military families. We will hold these landlords, and ourselves, accountable.\nRequire regular, standardized, objective, and published reporting of military family satisfaction and concerns from all housing.\nEstablish a public-facing document outlining expectations of quality and consequences for all housing providers and, when necessary, terminate long-term leases held by private companies.\n\nKnow our Families: Long periods of sustained war-fighting have made us reactive in our responses to military family needs. To best support these families and optimize their health and well-being, we must improve our understanding of their current and emerging needs. We can't be caught on our heels. We must anticipate and prepare solutions that respond to the evolving needs of military families across the military life cycle. We must be able to track and identify emerging trends so that we can be nimble and responsive to the changing needs of our military families.\nAs president, Biden will:\n\nConvene a multi-disciplinary working group of policy makers, program leaders, and research and subject-matter experts to construct a strategic research plan to inform solutions to support military families.\nDesignate specific resources for research and development related to military families outcomes within the budget of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, to include resources for research within both the Military Family and Community Policy and the Defense Health Program.\nRequire that DoD work across the federal government to leverage national and state-level assessments of health and well-being to ensure they appropriately assess military affiliation in ongoing data collections across the United States. It is imperative that all national surveys include variables that allow us to examine how well military families fare relative to others.\n\n",

    "text": "\nA group of 133 former national security, foreign service, and military officials who have served in nearly every major national security institution across seven administrations are endorsing Joe Biden for President today.\nThe size and breadth of today's cohort of endorsers highlight both the extreme threat that Donald Trump poses to our nation and our world, and the widespread belief among those who've devoted their lives to keeping America safe that Biden is the candidate best prepared to step in as commander in chief, restore our global standing, and once again put Americans' security ahead of politics.\nToday's endorsers include dozens of former deputy, under, and assistant secretaries of Defense, State, and Homeland Security and other national security departments and agencies; and scores of former ambassadors, career foreign service officers, and other top national security and intelligence officials.\nAmong them are former National Security Advisor Tom Donilon, former Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Advisor Lisa Monaco, former Deputy CIA Director and Deputy National Security Advisor Avril Haines, former Under Secretary of State Nick Burns, and former Assistant Secretary of State Linda Thomas-Greenfield.\n\"Joe Biden knows that U.S. security depends on strong U.S. leadership. He has the knowledge, experience, and credibility necessary to protect our national security and advance our democratic values in an increasingly chaotic and complex world,\" said Lisa Monaco, former Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Advisor to President Obama.\n\"When he was Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he gave me unstinting support in the final stages of my negotiation of the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Agreement which required two votes in the Congress,\" said Ambassador Nicholas Burns, former Under Secretary of State and Ambassador to NATO and to Greece. \"And when I was Ambassador to NATO, he was equally supportive in helping us to rally Europe to our side after 9/11, on Russia and the expansion of NATO itself. No member of Congress was more helpful and more knowledgeable about foreign and defense policy than Joe Biden. Joe Biden has the experience in the White House and Senate to keep us safe and to lead us towards a more positive and peaceful future. That's why I am proud to support Joe Biden for President and to be part of his historic campaign.\"\n\"America's standing in the world and our ability to advance the interests and values of the American people have taken a big hit these past three years. We need a new president in 2020, and Vice President Biden is the best candidate to bring us back to stable ground, repair the damage done, and restore our place in the world from his first day in office,\" said Antony Blinken, former Deputy Secretary of State and Deputy National Security Advisor, now a senior advisor to Biden's campaign. \"Vice President Biden knows the leaders and knows the issues, and he can immediately pick up the phone to start fixing the damage that President Trump has done. I've seen him over decades around the world, in eye-to-eye meetings with our nation's toughest rivals and closest allies, and working hand-in-hand with our diplomats and our military. He has put country before personal or partisan interests throughout his career. The public servants who join me in supporting him today know that the Vice President has the experience to keep this nation's more than 320 million people safe from day one. And they know that he's devoted to rebuilding American leadership – not as a slogan, but as a beacon of democracy, human rights, and hope for people around the world.\"\nEarlier today, Biden for President released \"Moment,\" a new ad that will air across broadcast and digital in Iowa that highlights how our nation is in crisis with Trump in the White House and that the country needs Joe Biden to restore respected leadership on the world stage and dignified leadership at home. The ad will air in top Iowa television markets and statewide on digital platforms like Hulu, YouTube, and more.\nBiden's Foreign Policy Background\nJoe Biden has devoted much of his life to the purposeful practice of national security and foreign policy, including 34 years on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he spent 12 years as chair or ranking member. Biden played a key role in shaping a stable, post-Cold War order – pushing transformational arms control agreements through the U.S. Senate, including the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, a global treaty banning all chemical weapons; and the 2010 New START Treaty with Russia, significantly reducing the number of strategic nuclear warheads deployed. He worked for years to strengthen and expand NATO, a foundation of global security and American strength; was a leading voice driving U.S. efforts to stop ethnic cleansing in Bosnia; and supported the promotion of democracy and human rights around the world from the Baltics to the Balkans.\nAs Vice President, Biden traveled to more than 50 countries, building personal relationships with our closest allies, as well as negotiating directly with adversaries and competitors. Biden served as President Obama's trusted point-person on some of the administration's toughest foreign policy challenges, including the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq; and he helped to deliver some of its most historic diplomatic achievements, including the Paris climate accord and Iran nuclear deal. And, Biden was a strong voice for U.S. engagement with Latin America, building partnerships with emerging powers like Brazil and Mexico, supporting peace in Colombia, promoting energy security in the Caribbean, defending democracy in Venezuela; and forging bipartisan consensus for a strategy to address the root causes of migration from Central America – reflecting his core belief in the power of working with friends and partners to head off crises, not antagonizing our allies.\nBiden's Plan to Lead the Democratic World to Meet the Challenges of the 21st Century\nAs president, Biden will work to secure our strong democracy, our dynamic and innovative economy, and a stable global order, restoring American credibility so that we once again lead the world by the power of our example, and not just the example of our power. He'll start by renewing our democracy at home, defending voting rights, election security, the free press, and civil discourse; and reinvigorating the coalition of democracies that stand with us, united around our shared values. Biden will also work to ensure that the rules of the global economy aren't rigged against American workers – not only negotiating trade deals to benefit them, but equipping them to succeed in a global economy by investing in health care, education, infrastructure, and innovation, and protecting their rights to organize. And, Biden has vowed to renew American leadership around clear foreign policy goals and consistent strategies; and to mobilize the world to fight the defining threats of our time, from nuclear proliferation and terrorism, to climate change, mass migration, and the disruptive impact of new technologies.\nToday's complete list of endorsers includes:\n\nLeslie Alexander, Former Ambassador to Ecuador, to Mauritius and to Comoros, and Former Chief of Mission in Haiti\nMatthew Axelrod, Former Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General\nElizabeth Bagley, Former Ambassador to Portugal and Former Special Representative, Global Partnerships, Department of State\nRobert Barry, Former Ambassador to Bulgaria and to Indonesia, Former State Department Coordinator, Assistance to Central and Eastern Europe\nMatthew Barzun, Former Ambassador to Sweden and to the United Kingdom\nMichael Battle, Former Ambassador to the African Union\nDenise Bauer, Former Ambassador to Belgium\nJack R.

    "text": "\nToday, Texas State Senator Beverly Powell, an unwavering public education advocate who represents District 10 in Northern Texas, released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:\n\"As the proud product of Texas public schools, the daughter of a history teacher, and a former working single mother, education has played a pivotal role in my life. My story is not unique, but it is significant — and Joe Biden understands that.\n\"Joe knows that a quality education is the driving force behind economic mobility. Joe knows the trepidation of crippling debt that saddles American families and prevents them from buying a home. And Joe knows that education is necessary to building a pathway to the middle class.\n\"In today's economy, a high school diploma is not enough to remain competitive and earn family-sustaining wages. That's why as a single mother I went back to college — to provide a better life for myself and my family.\n\"We need a president who understands the power of a good education that prepares us all to succeed in a 21st century economy. I know that Joe will fight for all hard-working Americans and give them a shot at the middle class, regardless of their skin tone or zip code. That's why I am proud to endorse a champion for educators, teachers, and students: Joe Biden.\"\nState Senator Powell's endorsement builds on the campaign's growing momentum in key swing states like Texas, and continues to lay the groundwork for Biden's historic push to turn Texas blue in 2020.\nLast week, Biden won the backing of Texas Congressman Marc Veasey from the Dallas Fort Worth area. In Texas, a growing number of elected officials and state leaders are backing Joe, reflecting his campaign's growing momentum in the crucial Super Tuesday state. Those supporters include Congressman Marc Veasey, Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, Congressman Filemon Vela, Congressman Vicente Gonzalez, former Congressman Gene Green, former Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings, Brownsville Mayor Trey Mendez, State Senator Nathan Johnson, State Rep. Victoria Neave, 2018 Lt. Governor candidate Mike Collier, and Cameron County Judge Eddie Treviño.\nTo date, Biden for President has drawn support from more than 600 national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, and community leaders.\n",

Citing his bold vision for the country, ambitious plan to build on Obamacare with a public option, and decades of foreign policy experience, the Lee County leaders agree Joe Biden is the best candidate to beat Donald Trump.\n\"What's most important in this election is that we nominate a candidate who can beat Donald Trump – and Joe Biden is the only one who fits that bill,\" said George Morgan of Keokuk, former Lee County Veterans Affairs Commission Chair, Lee County Supervisor and Keokuk Police Chief. \"Joe has a well-established understanding and interest in Iowa's ethanol industry and, as president, he'll invest in rural America to create jobs and grow our agricultural economy. We need a president who'll stand up for middle class folks again – and that's Joe Biden.\"\n\"Let's be clear – Donald Trump is trying to pick the Democratic nominee, because polls show that Joe Biden will beat Trump like a drum next November,\" said Ron Fedler of West Point, Lee County Supervisor. \"Joe Biden has the experience it takes to walk into the Oval Office and get things done on day one. From building on Obamacare to restoring our standing in the world, I'm caucusing for Joe because he doesn't need on-the-job training – he's the right candidate for this moment in history.\"\n\"With the turmoil in our country and around the world, Joe Biden is the best person to step in and tackle these pressing challenges,\" said Gene Fraise of Fort Madison, former State Senator. \"Joe can get the country back on track. Unlike President Trump, he knows a thing or two about farming and ethanol – and he won't turn his back on farm country.\"\n\"I think Joe has the knowledge and experience to lead our country back to being a respectable nation our allies can support and rely on in these trying times,\" said Vernon Benjamin of Argyle, former Lee County Democrats Chair.\n\"For me, there's really no other choice than Joe Biden in this Democratic primary,\" said Christine Spann, Lee County Treasurer. \"As Barack Obama's Vice President, Joe was a loyal and effective partner — working with both parties to get real results for American families. He's the best choice we have to beat Donald Trump and elect a real leader to the White House — and that's why I hope my fellow Iowans will join me caucusing for Joe Biden on February 3.\"\nThe endorsements come after Vice President Biden and Dr. Jill Biden held several community events and office openings in Lee County and Southeast Iowa last month. So far, more than 100 current and former Iowa elected officials, union leaders, teachers, veterans, community leaders, and Democratic Party activists have announced their support for Vice President Biden.\n",

I know that Joe can win in tough districts all across this country, giving Democrats a lift up and down the ballot. And once in office, Joe is the one candidate who has what it takes to work with the other side to get real things done. Time and again, I saw President Barack Obama turn to Joe when he needed progress in Congress, and Joe always delivered. That's what the American people need now: someone who knows how to make the system work. In a representative government, you're supposed to respect one another's opinions, and out of that, come up with something that moves our country forward. That's what Joe Biden is all about.\"\nSchrader is the 19th U.S. Member of Congress to endorse Biden, who has so far built the broadest and most diverse coalition in the presidential race. Districts like Schrader's – which spans rural and urban areas – reflect that diverse support, and will be key to winning the presidency in 2020.\nTo date, Biden for President has won the endorsement of more than 600 national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, and community leaders – a sign of Vice President Biden's growing momentum in the nominating race.\n",

The Vilsacks will join Vice President Biden and Dr. Jill Biden for campaign stops later today in Des Moines and Knoxville, the first of many events the Vilsacks will attend for Biden across the Hawkeye State until the caucus on Feb. 3.\nWith just over 70 days until the Iowa Caucus, the endorsements are a significant show of strength for the Biden campaign. The Vilsacks are among Iowa's most coveted endorsements, and two of Iowa and America's most trusted leaders, especially among rural voters. A fierce advocate for rural America, Tom Vilsack served as a two-term Iowa governor and Secretary of Agriculture for the entirety of the Obama-Biden Administration, and he advised Biden on his ambitious plan to revitalize rural communities.\nChristie Vilsack is a lifelong educator who served as First Lady of Iowa and was a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives – advocating for families, women, and children throughout her entire career. As Iowa's First Lady, she was a tireless champion for education, literacy, and public libraries – and in the Obama-Biden Administration, she served as a Senior Advisor for International Education at the U.S. Agency for International Development.\nThe Vilsacks will champion Biden's rural agenda on the campaign trail, including pursuing trade policies that expand markets for producers, supporting new and beginning farmers, investing in agricultural research, expanding rural broadband, supporting Iowa's ethanol industry, and partnering with farmers to fight climate change.\nRead more from Secretary Vilsack in USA Today:\n\"As I thought about the candidate who has the ability to bring us together as one nation, the progressive but practical vision for progress at home, the experience and personal relationships to repair America's image abroad, and the best chance at winning the states we have to win to govern I concluded that Joe Biden is the person for the job...\n\"I have known Joe Biden for over 30 years. I ran my first race for mayor, because Joe reminded me that the penalty for not getting involved is that people less qualified than you get elected. I learned from him how to work with others across the aisle as a state senator and governor. I remain privileged and honored to have worked with him for 8 years during the Obama Administration.\"\nRead more from Christie Vilsack in Lee Enterprises:\n\"I met Joe and Jill Biden 33 years ago when they came to Iowa to run for president. I trust them as much today as I did then, and that's why I'm supporting Joe in the Iowa Caucus in February...\n\"After a year of attending events, reading and listening to policy statements, and talking to other Iowans, it's clear to me that Joe is best positioned to beat Donald Trump next November.\"\nBiden will barnstorm Iowa on a \"No Malarkey\" bus tour from Nov. 30 to Dec. 7 – an eight-day, 18 county swing where he will meet with caucus goers across the entire state. In recent days, Biden's Iowa team has grown to include 26 offices and approximately 110 paid staffers on the ground – powering the campaign's 99-county, 1,678-precinct strategy to win the caucus. To date, Biden has earned the support of 175 current and former Iowa elected officials, union leaders, teachers, veterans, community leaders, and Democratic Party activists.\n",

I've had the privilege to work alongside Joe while he was Vice President.

Before that, Congresswoman Titus served as the Nevada State Senate Democratic Leader, from 1993 to 2008. As the dean of Nevada's congressional delegation, Congresswoman Titus has led the effort to block Yucca Mountain. She has been an outspoken advocate for expanding health care access, passing comprehensive immigration reform, and addressing gun violence in the wake of the October 1 shooting.\nCongresswoman Titus is the first sitting Democratic Member of Congress to endorse a 2020 candidate in the four early voting states. She joins 56 local leaders across Nevada who have endorsed Joe Biden for President.

    "text": "\nCongressman Ami Bera (D-CA), who has represented Sacramento County since 2013, today released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:\n\"Our nation's government is more broken than it has been at any point in my lifetime, and we need a problem-solver as president to fix the mess and deliver results for working families. Joe Biden is the only candidate with the experience, grit, and broad-based coalition needed to beat Donald Trump, boost Democrats up and down the ballot, and bring people together to get things done. I've always said, Washington should be a place for service, not self-interest. Joe has given his life to this country, fighting for hard-working families and our core American values; and turning progressive policies on health care to gun safety to nonproliferation into wins for families. Joe knows how to make government work, and how to connect with Americans of all stripes to win. More than ever, we need that kind of clear-eyed optimist leading our charge in 2020 and beyond.\"\nBera is the 21st member of the U.S. House of Representatives to endorse Biden, who has built the broadest and most diverse coalition in the presidential race to date. Purple districts like Bera's highlight the need for that kind of bridge-building, which will be key to winning the presidency in 2020, and to healing our divided nation.\nBera is also one of only three Democratic physicians in Congress.\n\"One of the most pressing issues for American voters is health care. As one of only three Democratic doctors in Congress, I know we must put forth ambitious plans that will expand coverage and address the cost of health care in a manner that will actually become law. Joe was on the frontlines helping to pass the Affordable Care Act, which expanded health care to millions of Americans. He is the candidate best suited to both protect our gains and get new health care legislation passed through a divided Congress at a time when Americans need it the most.\"\nTo date, Biden for President has announced more than 775 endorsements from national, state and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, national security leaders, and community leaders — a sign of Vice President Biden's growing momentum in the nominating race.\n",

For more than a decade, I had the privilege of working alongside Joe in the Senate and can personally attest to his unique ability to work across the aisle and get things done on behalf of the American people. From health care to climate change to helping Americans recover following the Great Recession, Joe has delivered on some of the most challenging issues facing our country. Plain and simple, Joe works for America.\n\"Restoring America's leadership abroad and repairing our relationships with our allies will be immediate priorities for the next president. It will require a leader that is a known and trusted quantity, and one that is not afraid to stand up for American values. That leader is Joe Biden.\n\"Americans are tired of gridlocked governance and divisive leadership. We need strong, positive leadership from the very top to remind Americans that we indeed are stronger when we work together. As president, Joe will be just that type of leader, and he will be ready to go on day one of the job.\"\nSenator Bryan joins 56 local leaders across Nevada who have endorsed Joe Biden for President, including Congresswoman Dina Titus who was the first early state Member of Congress to endorse a Democratic candidate just last week.

Joe and I both got into public service to make our country fairer for people and make the world safer. I've watched Joe do exactly that as a senator, statesman, and vice president. We served 24 years together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. When Chairman Biden became Vice President Biden, he didn't just hand me a gavel, but a legacy of getting things done with integrity and bipartisanship, and shared experiences on hundreds of thousands of miles traveled together building relationships around the world. He was a partner working to pass the NEW START Treaty that made us safer from the threat of nuclear proliferation. Four years when I later became Secretary of State, Joe was an advocate and an ally on the hardest issues, from diplomacy to end the Iranian nuclear threat that Donald Trump's let back out of the bottle, to building the military and diplomatic strategy that beat back ISIL and ultimately routed them from the territory they once held.\n\"Through it all, I've seen Joe tested in public service and tested in life itself. I know his character. I know the measure of a person who never stopped fighting for millions of Americans even as his beloved son was losing a heartbreaking battle with cancer. Joe's strength and his moral center are inspiring. But so are his skills as a leader. As a Senator, he stood up to war criminals in the Balkans, pushed arms control agreements through the Senate, and wrote one of the chamber's first-ever climate bills. I've seen him triumph – passing the landmark Violence Against Women Act, and beating the NRA to win an assault weapons ban. I saw him up close working to find the key votes needed to pass Obamacare and give us the biggest health care reform in history, doing what had eluded every president since Harry Truman. I've seen him consistently trusted as the President's point-person on everything from the Recovery Act that saved us from a second Great Depression, to addressing the crisis of unaccompanied minors and irregular migration from Central America in 2014.\n\"Joe has never shied away from a challenge. He has never lost his heart, his middle class Scranton values, his honor, his resilience, or his belief in putting country above all else.\n\"Joe will defeat Donald Trump next November. He's the candidate with the wisdom and standing to fix what Trump has broken, to restore our place in the world, and improve the lives of working people here at home.\"\nSecretary Kerry will join Joe Biden on the \"No Malarkey\" barnstorm on Friday, December 6 starting in Cedar Rapids, IA. Kerry will also travel to New Hampshire with Joe Biden on Sunday, December 8. Additional logistical details will be forthcoming.

Additionally, the campaign announced that former Governor Alejandro García Padilla, former Senator Zoé Laboy Alvarado, Senate Majority Leader Carmelo Ríos Santiago, and House Minority Leader Rafael \"Tatito\" Hernández Montañez will serve as co-chairs of the campaign's Puerto Rico for Biden Leadership Committee.\nThis historic slate — the largest bipartisan slate of Puerto Rican endorsements in a primary election — includes officials from both the Popular Democratic Party and the New Progressive Party, further demonstrating the unifying power of Joe Biden's vision for America and mission to restore the soul of the nation.\n\"We are honored to have the support and leadership of these public servants, and are excited to announce the co-chairs of the campaign's Puerto Rico for Biden Leadership Committee to ensure that Puerto Ricans have a voice in this presidential election,\" said Greg Schultz, Campaign Manager, Biden for President. \"After catastrophic hurricanes devastated the island's communities and infrastructure, Trump has done nothing for Puerto Rico except mock them and throw paper towels into the crowd. Today's slate of endorsements is emblematic of the island's need to have both a friend and ally in the White House — and the people of Puerto Rico know that Joe Biden will be that president.\"\nToday's endorsements include:\n\nFormer Governor Alejandro García Padilla\nFormer Senator Zoé Laboy Alvarado\nSenator Carmelo Ríos Santiago\nRep.

Vice President Biden also authored an op-ed today that appeared in the Orlando Sentinel and El Nuevo Día to outline his vision of progress for the island.\nPuerto Rico will play a defining role in the 2020 nominating contest. With 59 delegates in play, the Vice President's strong show of support in Puerto Rico highlights not only the growing enthusiasm and excitement behind his policy, but the extreme threat that Donald Trump poses to the future of the island. Moreover, on the two year anniversary of Hurricane Maria striking Puerto Rico, Biden for President released a video that drew a sharp contrast between how Donald Trump neglected the island in the face of devastation and underscored how Joe Biden would be a leader for all Americans, including those in Puerto Rico.\nBiden for President has previously announced more than 775 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, and community leaders.\n",

Jackson had previously backed Senator Kamala Harris.\n\"Joe Biden is the best Democratic candidate to defeat Donald Trump — and that's exactly what we need,\" said State Senator Jackson. \"I have seen his strength on display in the Palmetto State and I know we need to unite behind him.\"\n\"We need a leader who requires no on-the-job training. With a resume that cannot be matched by anyone running, Joe is that leader — and the most prepared to be Commander in Chief.\"\n\"Throughout the campaign, he has taken everyone's best shot and clearly demonstrated that he has what it takes to win this primary and the general election. Joe continues to show that he has the fight, fire, and strength to make Donald Trump a one-term president, which is in the best interest of this country and the citizens I represent.\"\nJackson joins more than 1oo current and former elected officials, community activists, and faith leaders in South Carolina now backing Joe Biden.

    "text": "\nDes Moines, Iowa — Today, 25 Iowa leaders — ranging from mayors and Democratic party chairs to Iowa state legislators and faith leaders — endorsed Joe Biden for President.\n\"Throughout his years of public service and in the Obama-Biden Administration, Joe has never changed – he's always been a man of integrity, empathy and character,\" said Ritchie Kurtenbach, President of the Waterloo Building and Construction Trades. \"In this time of great peril, we can't afford a rookie in the White House – Joe is the most qualified candidate in this race hands down. There is no learning curve with Joe, and his eight years as Barack Obama's Vice President has made him ready to be Commander in Chief on day one. We can't gamble in this election – we must beat Donald Trump – so I hope Iowans will join me caucusing for Joe on February 3.\"\n\"I endorse Joe Biden for President of the United States,\" said Iowa State Senator Herman Quirmbach of Ames. \"We live in divisive times and a dangerous world. America needs a new President, one who can heal the divisions at home, repair the trust and cooperation of our allies abroad, and regain respect for America and America's values from friend and foe alike. Joe Biden's vast international experience will be especially useful in reopening foreign markets for Iowa's farmers, whose income has been cut in half since the high point of the Obama-Biden Administration. We need Biden's experience at home, too, where for decades he has been effective at passing vital legislation to protect women from violence, to extend educational opportunities, and to expand access to health care for tens of millions. Most of all, we need a man of Joe Biden's character, a man of true warmth and compassion, a man who will restore dignity to the Office of President of the United States.\"\n\"I stand with Joe Biden because I know his heart — for years, he's been fighting for DREAMers because he knows it's the right thing to do and that all Americans just want a fair shot to succeed,\" said Alma Puga, President of LULAC Council 381 in Denison. \"As president, Joe will repair our country after Donald Trump's cruel immigration policies, restore America's values, welcome refugees and provide immigrants with a path to citizenship. Joe has my support because he's not only the best choice for president, he's also the best candidate to beat Donald Trump next November.\"\n\"I believe Vice President Joe Biden is the most qualified person running for President and when he speaks on foreign policy, he speaks with the moral clarity and strength that shows he is ready to be Commander in Chief on day one,\" said Brian Schoenjahn, former Mayor and Iowa State Senator from Arlington. \"Now is not the time for on the job training in the White House — it hasn't worked with Donald Trump, and there is far too much on the line to gamble in this election. It is time for decency, honesty, and integrity in the presidency. From building on Obamacare to working with allies to combat climate change, Joe brings dignified leadership both abroad and at home. I am honored to stand by Joe and ready to caucus for him in February.\"\n\"I've known Vice President Biden for the last twelve years and what has always stood out the most is his experience, wisdom and judgment,\" said Maxine Bussanmas, Mayor of Bevington. \"I have seen firsthand his leadership and his ability to be a steady voice for working families. We need a candidate who will heal and unify this nation. Joe has brought folks together his whole life – and he's the only candidate in this race that can appeal to folks in small towns and large, to Democrats and Republicans, and to people of all walks of life. He is building a broad base of voters, and I am proud to endorse Joe and I hope that Iowans will join me.\"\n\"Over the years, I've had the honor and privilege of praying with both President Obama and Vice President Biden on several occasions – and in Joe, I saw a man of character, faith, and integrity,\" said Rev. Steve Perkins of Bethel AME Church in Davenport. \"From foreign policy and climate change to jobs and justice, Joe has an ambitious agenda to steer our country back on track and give every American the dignity they deserve. Joe also has a unique ability to unite our country and bring people together across party lines, color or creeds. I am proud to support Joe Biden for President and will work with members of the community to help him win the Iowa Caucus.\"\nThe full list of endorsements includes:\n\nHerman Quirmbach, Iowa State Senator from Ames\nBrian Schoenjahn, former Iowa State Senator from Arlington\nJake Blitsch, former Iowa State Representative and U.S. Navy Veteran\nDave Fish, Mayor of Belle Plaine\nRoger Laughlin, Mayor of West Branch\nMaxine Bussanmas, Mayor of Bevington\nJohn Krogman, former Mayor of Atlantic and Atlantic Parks and Recreation Board Member\nJeri Vogt, Crawford County Supervisor\nRick Lincoln, Clinton County Sheriff\nLewis Rosser, former member of the Ames School Board\nAl Havens, Tiffin City Councilmember\nPat Taylor, Jefferson Township Trustee\nRev.

    "text": "\nFinkenauer Represents Iowa's Critical First District\nDubuque, Iowa — Today, Congresswoman Abby Finkenauer (IA-1), an Iowa native, former Iowa state representative, labor advocate, and one of the first Iowa women elected to the U.S. House, released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:\n\"I was raised in a small town in rural Iowa, where my family instilled in me the importance of hard work, caring for others, and most importantly the value of public service. I take those values with me every day in Washington, where I have made improving the lives of Iowa's working families my top priority.\n\"We need a President who reflects those same values and will make America's working families their top priority. Joe Biden's character, record, and commitment to rebuilding the backbone of the country — the middle class — is what Iowa and this country needs. Across the country, and especially in Iowa, too many families are being left behind by our current president. It's time we have leadership in the White House who believes in the value of not only uniting a divided Congress, but uniting our country through common sense, dignity, and respect.\"\nCongresswoman Finkenauer is one of the most coveted endorsements in Iowa and nationally. Notably, Finkenauer recently hosted eight presidential candidates at a forum, co-hosted by nine national labor unions, where she highlighted the importance of labor, jobs, and rebuilding Iowa's infrastructure. Finkenauer previously held a rally with Biden prior to her 2018 election victory. The event, held in Cedar Rapids, drew over 2,000 people.\nShe is the second youngest woman ever elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, and along with Representative Cindy Axne, is one of the first two women elected to represent Iowa in the U.S. House of Representatives. Backed by some of the strongest labor union support of any House candidate in the country due to her unwavering support of working families, Finkenauer flipped the district in 2018 after four years with a Republican Member of Congress. Finkenauer's four years of prior service in the Iowa State House cemented her dedication to working families and being a vocal opponent to policies that hurt her friends, families, and neighbors.\nAfter voting for President Obama and Vice President Biden in 2008 and 2012, Trump won Finkenauer's district in 2016.\nCongresswoman Finkenauer's endorsement builds on the expansive coalition of support across Iowa that Biden is building, including notable endorsements from former Secretary of Agriculture and two-term Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack and former First Lady of Iowa Christie Vilsack, Mayors, State Representatives, and City Councilman and many others — totaling more than 185 endorsements in Iowa.\nFinkenauer joins Congresswoman Dina Titus (NV-1) in endorsing Vice President Biden as the only two Members of Congress from the four early states to publicly announce their support in the race for the Democratic nomination. As one of the majority-makers of the new freshman class, Finkenauer's endorsement will undoubtedly carry weight and will be significant as her colleagues consider their own endorsement decisions.\nDCCC Frontline Co-Chair Congressman Ami Bera, former Ohio Governor Ted Strickland, BOLD PAC Chair Congressman Tony Cardenas, and Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin all endorsed Biden in recent weeks, citing his ability to help down ballot candidates win in tough races.\nJill and Joe Biden have continued to barnstorm across Iowa in the run up to the caucus, meeting with thousands of caucus-goers in communities of all sizes. Over the next five days, Biden will visit another 10 Iowa counties. Congresswoman Finkenauer will join Vice President Biden during his upcoming swing in Iowa with stops in Dubuque, Cedar Rapids, Independence, Waterloo, Vinton, Des Moines, Grinnell, and Davenport.\nBiden for President has previously announced more than 1,000 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.\n",

    "text": "\nAll Three Members Represent Key Battleground Districts in Virginia, Pennsylvania\nToday, Biden for President is announcing new endorsements from freshman Members of Congress Elaine Luria (VA-2), Chrissy Houlahan (PA-6), and Conor Lamb (PA-17),all of who represent districts in key battleground states that will play defining roles in the election next fall.\nReps. Luria and Lamb represent competitive congressional districts known as \"frontline\" districts that Democrats must protect to maintain their majority in the House of Representatives and ensure we defeat Donald Trump. Reps. Lamb and Luria's districts voted for Trump in 2016, and Houlahan flipped her district from red to blue in 2018.\nCongresswoman Elaine Luria of Virginia:\n\"Our current president has repeatedly failed to put country over party and his own personal gain. At this moment in history, we need a leader who is dedicated to correcting our course and restoring the soul of this nation. That's Joe Biden.\n\"Joe Biden is 'battle-tested' on the world stage, in Congress, and in the White House. He will defeat Donald Trump and win in tough districts like mine. When he walks into the Oval Office, he will immediately get to work, rebuild the middle class and restore our standing on the world stage. I proudly endorse Joe Biden for President of the United States.\"\nCongresswoman Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania:\n\"As an Air Force veteran, engineer, entrepreneur, and educator, I have always been driven by a spirit of service. These experiences played a significant role in shaping my values, character, and most importantly, my vision for America— a vision that Joe Biden shares. Joe Biden has an indisputable record of standing up and speaking out for American families, and most of all, getting things done.\n\"Our country needs a steady hand, someone who can help heal the country, an experienced and proven leader who can build teams with deep expertise and work across the aisle. We need a leader who will restore American leadership, revive our alliances, and defend democratic values around the world. Joe Biden is that leader. Like me, he believes that in this polarized environment, real change will come from pragmatic solutions that help working families. Pennsylvania is not red or blue but a purple place which our next President needs to carry to win. Joe Biden can win Pennsylvania, and I'm proud to endorse him.\"\nCongressman Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania:\n\"I have seen firsthand that Joe Biden knows the people of western Pennsylvania and shares our values. When he came to campaign for me last year, I saw huge crowds of working people cheer for him. I watched him stop and thank each police officer he passed. I heard him greet our local union leaders by name. Joe Biden respects our people, he knows what they are going through, and he knows what it means to keep your word.\n\"President Trump has not kept his word on some of the most important issues facing western Pennsylvania. He promised no cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, then cut billions from them in every single budget proposal — after passing a trillion dollar tax cut for the wealthy. He promised to protect people with preexisting conditions, then tried to repeal and overturn those same protections. When Joe Biden says he will protect Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, he means it. His record proves that he means it. When he says he will protect people with preexisting conditions, he is talking about something he went through in his own family.\n\"I believe that the next President must attempt to unify this country. President Trump has only driven people further apart. Joe Biden has promised to try, above all, to bring people together, and that's why I support him to become the next President of the United States.\"\nRep. Elaine Luria and Chrissy Houlahan currently serve together on both the House Armed Services Committee and the Servicewomen and Women Veterans Congressional Caucus. Congresswoman Luria served two decades in the Navy, retiring at the rank of Commander and currently leads the House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs. Rep. Chrissy Houlahan is an Air Force veteran and the founder of the Servicewomen and Women Veterans Congressional Caucus— a bipartisan forum to address the issues facing the women who have served our nation in uniform. Rep. Conor Lamb served in the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves, and is currently the Vice Chair of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\nDCCC Frontline Co-Chair Congressman Ami Bera and BOLD PAC Chair Congressman Tony Cardenas also recently endorsed Biden, citing his ability to help down ballot candidates win in tough races.\nBiden for President has previously announced more than 1,000 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.\n",

Johnson is an Associate Minister at Corinthian Baptist Church — a prominent African-American church in Des Moines.\n\"After serving as Vice President for eight years, I believe Joe Biden has seen what it is going to take to be the President of the United States,\" said Rev. Rob Johnson Associate Minister in Des Moines. \"Joe can tell voters not only what he wants to do, but what he's done — passed the Violence Against Women Act, banned assault weapons and helped get Obamacare across the finish line. The Vice President can empathize with folks and feel their pain. He knows what pain looks and feels like from his own experiences. When my nephews look at the President of the United States, I want them to find hope and see a leader they can look up to. In the next 29 days, I'm eager to help lead the Biden campaign's faith outreach efforts and speak with caucus-goers and people of Faith across the state about Joe's mission to restore the soul of this nation.\"\nAs an Associate Minister at Corinthian Baptist Church, Rev. Johnson has been a leader in Des Moines and across the Hawkeye State. Recently, the Des Moines Register profiled Rev. Johnson and showcased his efforts to engage vulnerable youth and expand mental health awareness and named one of the paper's 15 people to watch in 2020. In helping to lead Biden for President's Iowa Faith Outreach efforts, Rev. Johnson will travel across the state and speak in churches about Biden's efforts to restore the soul of the nation and grow the middle class.\nTo date, Biden for President has announced nearly 200 endorsements in Iowa — including Congresswoman Abby Finkenauer's support this week. Rev. Johnson's endorsement builds on the expansive, broad coalition of support across Iowa that Biden is building, including notable endorsements from former Secretary of Agriculture and two-term Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack and former First Lady of Iowa Christie Vilsack, mayors, state representatives, and city council members and many others.\n",

The group is comprised of key figures from across the state, representing Vice President Biden's broad and growing support across the Hawkeye State.\n\"As a United States Senator, Joe Biden did something nobody else could do — he wrote and passed the landmark Violence Against Women Act, which finally defined a woman's fundamental human right to live free from violence. This law has changed – and saved – so many lives,\" said Bonnie Campbell, former Iowa Attorney General and the first director of the Department of Justice's Office of Violence Against Women. \"Joe has all the characteristics we hope for in an American president.

As president, Joe will check the abuse of corporate power, encourage unionization and collective bargaining, and ensure workers receive the pay and benefits they've earned.\"\n\"Without question, Joe Biden is the most qualified candidate running for president,\" said Iowa State Representative John Forbes from Urbandale. \"After serving alongside President Obama, Joe is prepared to hit the ground running on day one and address our issues both at home and abroad. We have a lot to correct after the damage done these past four years — not just with policy, but to restore the values America stands for and to bring our country together again.\"\n\"Like so many Iowa Democrats, I take our caucus role seriously and have met nearly all of our candidates up close,\" said Iowa State Representative Mary Gaskill of Ottumwa. \"While we have many excellent candidates, Joe Biden stands out to me as not only the most authentic, but also the best candidate to beat Donald Trump in November. Joe is a person of unquestionable character, and as the author of the Violence Against Women Act, he has been a champion of women's rights throughout his career in public service. Beating Donald Trump starts right here in Iowa, so on caucus night, I will be in Joe's corner.\"\n\"I've known Joe for more than 25 years, and through it all, he's never changed,\" said Staci Appel, former Iowa State Senator and candidate for Congress from Indianola. \"Joe has always given a voice to women and families – and as president, he'll fight to pass universal pre-K so all of our children have a fair shot to succeed. There's so much on the line in this election – and we, as Iowans, must consider which candidate is best equipped to beat Donald Trump. That candidate is Joe Biden, and I'll be proud to caucus for him on February 3.\"\n\"Joe Biden stands out as the candidate with the most experience and the ability to lead our country forward,\" said Clinton County Auditor Eric Van Lancker. \"He is committed to restoring America's standing around the world — he can meet with leaders and he instantly commands their respect.

Rice released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:\n\"Since my earliest days as a City of Newark Council Member and Deputy Mayor, through my 34 years as a State Senator, I have done my best to bring attention to and correct social injustice in all its forms. As the longest-serving African-American legislator in state history, I have fought hard for comprehensive criminal justice reform; accessible, affordable health care; world-class, transformative education for our children and compassionate, empowering services for seniors. I have stood up for the rights, well-being and prosperity of all, regardless of neighborhood, social status and zip code.\n\"As America approaches the most consequential crossroad of our lifetimes, I raise my voice against the harm inflicted by our current President and stand in proud solidarity with those who choose to forge a future of fairness, decency, progress and hope. I stand united with those especially wounded by the current administration, black and brown citizens who've been neglected, abandoned and jeopardized by the nomination of right wing judges and oppressive legislation.\n\"Today, as an extension of my commitment to those I serve, I announce my support of Joe Biden for president of the United States. I do so with full confidence that he will stand up for all of us, and that he will especially champion the advancement of people of color. Since civil rights first brought him into public service, Joe Biden has never shied from calling out and tackling systemic racism. His vision for America is one based on equal opportunity for all — which is why I'm proud to endorse Joe Biden for president.\"\nSenator Rice's endorsement builds on the strong foundation of support that Joe Biden has already established in the state of New Jersey — including the recent endorsements of Congressman Donald Payne (NJ-10), Congressman Tom Malinowski (NJ-7), and former governors of New Jersey Jim Florio and Richard Codey.\nSenator Rice's endorsement highlights the breadth of Biden's proven record and commitment to the kitchen table issues that working families prioritize including comprehensive criminal justice reform, health care, education for our children and services for our aging population.\nBiden for President has previously announced more than 1,100 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.\n",

Joe is a man of honor and dignity, who has the strength and courage to bring people together and deliver results for working families across Iowa and the country. He is someone who appeals not only to Democrats, but to independents and Republicans as well. Iowans know that he will be ready on day one to lead this country.\n\"I decided to run for Congress in 2018 because I was frustrated with the decisions being made in Washington which were hurting hard-working, Iowa families - decisions that made life easier for corporations and billionaires, but much harder for Iowa's middle class. Joe Biden knows how to fix this: he was born and raised in a middle class household similar to mine and so many of my constituents'. And, he has never forgotten where he is from. The issues that matter to people - quality healthcare, a good education for kids, a strong economy that lifts all of us, climate change - matter to Joe Biden. He's not afraid to reach across the aisle to build bipartisan consensus. That's why I am supporting his campaign, and that's why I am confident Joe Biden will be an excellent President of the United States.\"\nCongresswoman Axne's endorsement is one of the most important in Iowa and the country, boosting Biden's campaign just ahead of the caucus. Along with Congresswoman Abby Finkenauer (IA-1), Biden has now been endorsed by both Iowa Fronlintline candidates and both of the first women to represent Iowa in the House of Representatives. Axne and Finkenauer both defeated Repbulican incumbents in Trump districts in 2018.\nCongresswoman Cindy Axne is a fifth generation Iowan raised in a tight-knit family on the South Side of Des Moines who spent summers on her maternal grandparents' farm in Warren County. From 2005 to 2014, Cindy worked for the State of Iowa, helping state agencies deliver government services more effectively and efficiently and saving tens of millions for Iowa taxpayers under both Democratic and Republican administrations. After working at the State, Cindy focused on growing the digital design firm she runs with her husband John.\nIn 2018, Cindy was elected to the U.S. Congress to represent Iowa's 3rd Congressional District, and along with Congresswoman Finkenauer became the first women to represent Iowa in the U.S. House of Representatives.\nThe 3rd Congressional District covers Iowa's southwest corner, and includes Polk, Dallas, Guthrie, Warren, Madison, Adair, Cass, Pottawattamie, Mills, Fremont, Page, Montgomery, Taylor, Adams, Union and Ringgold counties.\nBiden for President has announced more than 200 Iowa endorsements — including Attorney General Tom Miller, Congresswoman Abby Finkenauer, former Secretary of Agriculture and Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack, former First Lady of Iowa Christie Vilsack, former Governor Chet Culver, and former Attorney-General Bonnie Cambell.

    "text": "\nThis evening, the Sioux City Journal editorial board endorsed Joe Biden for President, citing his unmatched depth of experience on foreign and domestic policy, pragmatic plan to build on Obamacare with a public option, and unique ability to unite the country. The Journal endorsement comes on the same day Iowa swing district Congresswoman Cindy Axne announced her support for Vice President Biden.\nExcerpts of the endorsement are included below.\nSioux City Journal: OUR OPINION: Biden represents best choice in Iowa caucuses\nBecause he is, in our view, the candidate best positioned to give Americans a competitive head-to-head matchup with President Trump [...] members of The Journal editorial board today endorse the candidacy of Joe Biden, the former U.S. senator and vice president, in Iowa's first-in-the-nation Feb. 3 Democratic Party caucuses.\nWhy do we believe Biden represents the best shot Democrats have within this field to get the ultimate prize they want? Three primary reasons:\n\nHe possesses a greater breadth and depth of knowledge on issues domestic and foreign [...] than his rivals.\nHe articulates moderate positions on issues more in line with the nation as a whole. Unlike some candidates in this race, he doesn't guarantee a world he can't deliver and most Americans don't want. On health care, for example, he proposes to build upon the Affordable Care Act with inclusion of a public option instead of a government-run, single-payer health care system with a pricetag in the trillions and trillions of dollars at a time when the nation's debt is more than $20 trillion. We believe many more Americans would consider the former approach than would consider the latter.\nHe combines respect from both sides of the aisle and the political and personal skills necessary to unite conflicting positions behind common-ground solutions to complex issues facing our country. We view Biden as a pragmatist - and we believe his pragmatism is an attribute. We refuse to believe middle-of-the-road compromise should be or is a relic of the past. This nation is too diverse for any one side to insist on everything and employ an all-or-nothing approach. We believe leaders who embrace the greater good remain important, if not essential to our national dialogue today. If the Democratic nominee emerges as the winner in November, he or she will need to work with others to meet America's challenges at home and abroad.\n\n",

For 40 years, Dr. Adams taught at Bennett College, an HBCU in Greensboro, North Carolina. While at Bennett, she led the effort to increase student civic participation coining the phrase \"Bennett Belles are Voting Belles\" and organizing annual marches to the polls. As a former educator, Adams has dedicated her career to improving the lives of young people and her community.\nAdams' endorsement adds to the growing momentum Joe Biden has established in North Carolina, a critical Super Tuesday state. She joins North Carolina Congressman G. K. Butterfield, a prominent member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and the Chair of the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus, Paul Lowe, in supporting Biden. Biden has been building a broad and diverse coalition across the South, winning the support of Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin, Senator Doug Jones, Congresswoman Terri Sewell, Georgia State Rep. Pedro Marin, and other community leaders.\nNationally, Biden for President has announced more than 1,100 endorsements from national, state and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, and community leaders.\n",

    "text": "\nWillis and Watson previously served as co-chairs of Senator Kamala Harris' South Carolina campaign\nToday, two South Carolina Democratic leaders, Marguerite Willis and Melissa Watson, endorsed Joe Biden for President of the United States. Willis is a former candidate for governor, Florence attorney, president of the South Carolina Women Lawyers Association, and an outspoken advocate for equal pay in the Palmetto State. Watson is a candidate for South Carolina's 7th congressional district, the former 2nd Vice Chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, and a public school teacher. Both Willis and Watson formerly served as co-chairs of Senator Kamala Harris' South Carolina campaign.\n\"Senator Harris was a critical voice in this race and we owe her a great deal of gratitude, but it is time for us to unite around one candidate —one candidate who can beat Donald Trump,\" said former candidate for governor and Florence attorney, Marguerite Willis. \"There are a lot of great ideas in this primary, but we need more than ideas —we need results. Figuratively, my house is on fire right now. And, I don't need a full remodel or even new furniture while it continues to burn. I need someone who can put the fire out. Our country is torn apart and we need a president who can stop the burning and heal. That's what I see in Joe Biden, someone who can immediately repair the damage Donald Trump has caused. Joe often says that character is on the ballot this year and I couldn't agree more. We are known by the company we keep, and Joe is the right person at such a critical moment.\"\n\"Following Kamala Harris' departure from the race, the first thing that drew me to Joe Biden was his wife and teacher, Dr. Jill Biden. I'm a public school teacher and I feel confident that with Dr. Biden at his side we will finally have a true advocate for education in the White House,\" said Berkeley County Democratic Party Chair Melissa Watson. Now is the time for us to make a choice. Joe Biden is the one who can get things done. With growing conflicts abroad made worse by Donald Trump, we need someone with a cool, level headed grasp on foreign policy. Joe Biden has the respect from leaders around the world and his experience knows no match.\"\n\"And finally, we have to remember that at the end of all of this we need to be united as one. I think the best person to do that is Joe Biden. I think he has proved a lot of people wrong. He's shown he can weather a storm and he has what it takes to beat Donald Trump- the darkest storm of all,\" Watson said.\nWillis and Watson add to the growing support and diverse coalition of Palmetto State leaders who have previously announced their support for Joe Biden, including more than 20 state lawmakers; dozens of mayors, community activists, and local elected officials; and more than 100 pastors and faith leaders.\nNationally, Biden for President has announced more than 1,100 endorsements from national, state and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.\n",

That leader is Joe Biden, which is why I am proud to endorse him for President of the United States.\n\"Donald Trump has turned his back on America's most trusted allies, chipped away at America's reputation on the world stage, and fueled global crises.

Winning the White House rests on the shoulders of critical battleground states where I know Joe can beat Donald Trump while also propelling Democrats into state legislative chambers, Congress, and Governors mansions.

Palmetto State educators are announcing their support for Vice President Biden, citing his long record of demonstrated support for public schools, teachers, and students.\nBiden has released a robust education plan that would invest in every child at birth, provide a path to careers for middle and high school students, provide more resources to schools, and give educators the pay and respect they deserve.\nLast year, thousands of South Carolina educators courageously marched to the state capitol to demand just that from state lawmakers. Since then they have united and organized behind local leaders who prioritize an education policy that comes from the classroom. This group will undoubtedly boost our campaign's grassroots efforts on the ground with nearly 30 days left until South Carolina's primary.\nBiden for President also named former Governor and Secretary of Education Dick Riley, former State Superintendent of Education Inez Tenenbaum, and other education leaders as co-chairs of the campaign's South Carolina Educators for Biden effort.\n\"Joe and I are grateful for every leader who stands by us in this race, but as a teacher myself, I am especially proud of the many educators who have joined our campaign,\" said Dr. Jill Biden. \"Joe understands that the best education policy doesn't come from politics —it comes from classrooms and the educators who do this work every day. He will honor our profession with the respect and dignity it deserves —and that includes appointing a Secretary of Education who has public classroom experience.\"\n\"I'm proud to stand with Joe Biden once again in the fight to improve our nation's education system and support our country's educators,\" said Dick Riley, former South Carolina Governor and former U.S. Secretary of Education. \"He was an excellent partner in the Senate during my time in the Clinton Administration. I am confident a Joe Biden administration will not rest until every child, no matter their zip code or the color of their skin, has access to a high- quality education. Joe understands the necessity of making quality education accessible to everyone. With Joe as president and Dr. Jill Biden as first lady, teachers, and students will have two true education advocates in the White House.\"\n\"In his decades of public service, Joe Biden has always remained laser focused on providing students and educators the resources they need to succeed, said Inez Tenenbaum, Former State Superintendent of Education and Obama-Biden Administration Chairman of

Joe not only has the experience to lead and achieve progressive results, but he is also our best candidate to win in November.\n\"Throughout this campaign, Joe has built a broad, diverse coalition and that's what it's going to take to beat Donald Trump. Here in Iowa, he's engaged young leaders in the Waterloo community – and most importantly, he's listened.\n\"Joe also knows that health care is personal, just like it is to me and so many Iowans. With President Obama, he worked tirelessly to pass the Affordable Care Act. As president, Joe has the experience to build on that monumental law with a public option – which would bring down costs for folks in Waterloo and across the state.\n\"Joe is the real deal. He's authentic, relatable, and tough – but he also has the empathy I want in our president. I hope folks in Waterloo will join me caucusing for Joe on Monday night.\"\nBiden for President has announced more than 210 Iowa endorsements – including notable support in Black Hawk County from State Rep. Ras Smith, Rev. Dr. Frantz Whitfield of Mt. Carmel Missionary Baptist Church, State Rep.

    "text": "\nToday, the Mayor of Richmond, Virginia Levar Stoney released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:\n\"I was a product of the Virginia public school system and grew up eating free and reduced lunch while my father worked hard as a custodian. I was the first in my family to receive a high school diploma and I was the first African-American to serve as Secretary of the Commonwealth of Virginia. I personally have experienced the obstacles that bar hard working Americans from the middle class.\n\"In order to break the cycle of poverty, Americans need basic resources such as access to affordable and quality health care, good education, and economic opportunities. We need a president that will prioritize giving working families the shot at the American dream that they deserve. That's why I'm endorsing Joe Biden for president. He has dedicated his life to public service and to giving a voice to those who don't have one. He has always stood up for what was right and will continue too as president.\"\nMayor Stoney is the youngest Mayor ever elected to serve the city of Richmond, Virginia. Prior to becoming Mayor, Stoney served as the first African American Secretary of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the youngest member of Governor Terry McAuliffe's cabinet. As Secretary, he worked to restore civil and voting rights, and under his leadership Virginia restored more rights than any other state in the country and more than the past seven administrations combined. Additionally, Mayor Stoney played a critical role in President Obama's 2008 victory as Executive Director of the Democratic Party of Virginia and served as Deputy Campaign Manager for Governor McAuliffe's successful gubernatorial bid.\nMayor Stoney's endorsement highlights the strength of both Biden's record and commitment to civil rights. Biden has never been afraid of calling out and tackling systemic racism and has openly spoken about how voter suppression has been used in recent elections to suppress black voters and that voter fraud is a lie. As Senator, Biden introduced the Justice Integrity Act to fight inequality in the criminal justice system and led the opposition to Jeff Sessions' nomination to become a U.S. district judge because of Session's history of racially insensitive comments—ultimately resulting in the Senate Judiciary Committee rejecting the nomination.\nMayor Stoney's endorsement builds on the foundation of support that Vice President Biden has already built in Virginia— including the recent slate of 18 elected officials and community leaders that endorsed, in addition to Congressional endorsements from Representatives Elaine Luria and Donald McEachin. Additionally, a recent Mason Dixon poll highlighted that Biden is the sole Democrat who beats Trump in the state, reinforcing the fact that Biden is the strongest candidate to make Trump a one-term president.\nBiden for President has previously announced more than 1,100 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.\n",

Joe Biden's broad and diverse coalition of support -- in addition to his authentic calls for re-unifying our country -- show me that he is that candidate,\" said Assemblywoman Selena Torres, District 3. \"As a Clark County public school teacher, the current administration's attacks on our public education are extremely personal. The next president must possess the political will and sense of urgency necessary to undo the harm of Betsy Devos. He or she also will also be tasked with making progress on pressing issues like school overcrowding and keeping our schools safe from gun violence. Joe's comprehensive education plans address the concerns I see daily and more importantly, I am confident that he is the leader that will be able to work closely with Congress to actually implement change. I'm proud to join Team Joe and am excited to do my part in ensuring he wins the caucus here in February.\"\n\"After many months of contemplation and review of practical, effective public policies that America can cash a check and pay for, I decided to endorse Joe Biden. I believe he is the transitional figure who can re-establish the Constitutional foundations of our American government that promote inclusion, equity, parity, and consensus. I believe he is the American figure who can restore a transparent government that embraces and respects the three branches of government and preserves the checks and balances established by the Constitution,\" said Assemblywoman Dina Neal, District 7. \"I believe he will provide a safeguard against factions who want to divide America and dismantle hard-fought civil rights achievements of this nation. We have come too far in building the American story of multiculturalism, integrity, and equal justice for all American citizens. I know he understands America is flawed, but it is nothing without the great human diversity and values that make the rich fabric of America. I also believe Joe has the capacity to repair our relationships with foreign countries through balanced international policies that protects American troops, workers and businesses. Finally, I believe on domestic policy, he has effective and practical solutions to expand health care to the working families who operate just above the poverty line, but who need sustainable and affordable access to health care. He has a plan for effective and practical solutions that integrate and respect rural American farms and allow them to participate in global markets. I am supporting Biden because I want to be a part of the taking back the story of 'our' America - one that recognizes Langston Hughes' plea: 'I, too, am America!'\"\nBoth Torres and Neal represent portions of Greater Las Vegas in the Nevada State Assembly. Torres and Neal join more than 100 endorsers from across Nevada, including Congresswoman Dina Titus, former Senator and Governor Richard Bryan, former Governor Bob Miller, and three former Chairs of the Nevada State Democratic Party.

    "text": "\nProminent Former and Current Elected Officials in Early & Super Tuesday States Highlight Biden's Broad Appeal, Diverse Winning Coalition\nToday, in a sign of strength after the Iowa caucuses, Biden for President is announcing key endorsements from prominent former and current elected officials from South Carolina, Virginia, California, Alabama, and Arkansas — critical early, Super Tuesday, and battleground states. The endorsements — which come from deep blue and bright red states across the country — illustrate Biden's broad appeal and unique ability to win the Democratic nomination, beat Trump, and unify the country. And, today's endorsements demonstrate diverse coalition that Biden is assembling and is critical to not just winning the nomination, but winning the White House.\n\"We are grateful for the support Iowa showed last night and excited to welcome these new leaders from important states to Team Joe as the primary continues over the next few weeks and months. Joe Biden has built an unmatched coalition of diverse and enduring support from coast to coast that can win the nomination and ensure we defeat Donald Trump next November,\" said Kate Bedingfield, Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director, Biden for President. \"We are ready to compete in the next early states, Super Tuesday states, and beyond so that Joe Biden can unify the Democratic party and our country and then deliver on the most pressing issues for Americans as president.\"\nToday's endorsements include:\n\nAlex Padilla, California Secretary of State\n\nSherman Lea, Mayor of Roanoke, Virginia\nTimothy Ragland, Mayor of Talladega, Alabama\nMark Pryor, former Senator and Attorney General of Arkansas\nDavid Pryor, former Senator and Governor of Arkansas\nJim Hodges, former Governor of South Carolina\nRachel Hodges, former First Lady of South Carolina\n\n\"Joe Biden has the vision and record to beat Donald Trump and restore the American Dream — the same American Dream that inspired my parents to come to the United States in search of a better life. Joe has spent his life serving others and he's our best progressive champion, because on the issues that working families care about most — from health care and education to immigration and workers' rights — only Joe has the experience, the relationships, and the broad coalition of support to deliver meaningful improvement in the lives of all Americans,\" said California Secretary of State Alex Padilla. \"I know this, because Joe has done it his entire career, as a leader in the U.S. Senate and as President Obama's right hand: banning assault weapons, expanding voting rights, lifting our country out from the great recession, and passing our most sweeping health care reform in generations, saving millions of lives. Today, Joe is our best bet toward building on that progress by defeating Trump, healing our divisions, and bringing us together to bring about real change.\"\n\"This moment demands a leader who can unify the country and that's Joe Biden,\" said former Governor Jim Hodges of South Carolina. \"I had the fortune of getting to know Joe when I served as the Obama campaign's national co-chair in 2008, and I watched for eight years as he worked alongside President Obama as an invaluable partner in the White House. Now it's Joe's time to lead. The nation needs him and our party needs him, especially in South Carolina. The ripple effects of nominating the wrong person at the top of the ticket will be felt everywhere, but even more so in the South. We need someone with the unique ability to help us elect down-ballot candidates and move the Palmetto State forward.\"\n\"Jim and I have known Joe Biden for a long time and we've always known that he relates to people in a way that most politicians can't,\" said former First Lady Rachel Hodges of South Carolina. \"People see themselves in him, and because of the tragedy and hardships he has overcome in his life, people see their struggles in his. South Carolina voters know that the issues they care about are personal to Joe and because of that, they trust him beyond a shadow of doubt.\"\n\"Our nation is at a crossroads: divided, disillusioned, and full of distrust, with more and more fellow Americans left behind. In this election, Democrats have to pick a winner who can heal the discord and build a more just, inclusive future – and who will, first and foremost, get Donald Trump out of the White House and out of our lives. Joe Biden is the one candidate with the compassion and coalition to beat Trump all across this country, and with the track record to fix the mess and end the hate,\" said Mayor Sherman Lea of Roanoke, Virginia. \"Joe has fought on the right side of history for his whole life – for civil rights, voting rights, workers' rights, gun safety, health care, and so much more – and he's the champion we need now to lead us forward.\"\n\"In this election, we need a candidate who can speak to the hearts of all Americans—a candidate who can build a diverse coalition across geographical boundaries and ensure that every person has a seat at the table. We also need a candidate with the type of experience that will launch us beyond false promises, political platitudes, and hyper-partisanship. Most notably, we need a candidate who can beat Donald Trump, and I believe Joe Biden is the candidate who can—and will—do just that. Not only will he fight for civil and voting rights, but he will support and partner with cities like mine as we seek to enhance our education, strengthen our infrastructure, attract more job opportunities, and provide health services for our constituents. Lives are at stake, and the future of this country depends on what we do right now. I pray we do not miss this opportunity. I am supporting Joe Biden, and I hope you will join me,\" said Mayor Timothy Ragland of Talladega, Alabama.\nWith a focus on early, Super Tuesday, and battleground states, Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,300 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.\n",

    "text": "\nToday, the Michigan Democratic Party Black Caucus, which previously supported Senator Kamala Harris, is endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States. Michigan Democratic Party Black Caucus Chair Keith Williams released the following statement announcing their support:\n\"We have seen Donald Trump wreak havoc in our communities, create division and inflame hate for three years. The stakes in this election could not be higher. This is not the time for experimentation. This is the time for steady leadership from the White House. Joe Biden fought for our communities as Barack Obama's Vice President. Together, they passed and implemented Obamacare, expanding health care to millions of Michigan residents, protecting millions more with pre-existing conditions. And, together they saved the auto industry and strengthened the United Auto Workers, putting our workers first.\"\nThe endorsement of the Michigan Democratic Party Black Caucus adds to the growing number of endorsements that Joe Biden already has already garnered in Michigan — including from Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, State Representatives Joe Tate, Karen Whitsett, and Tenisha Yancey, and State Senator Marshall Bullock. This endorsement is reflective of the strong support that Joe Biden has earned within the African American community and speaks to his record of delivering for working families on the kitchen table issues that have been under attack — such as health care, unions, and a pathway to the middle class.\nBiden for President has previously announced more than 1,300 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.\n",

This group includes both existing endorsers of Biden for President and new additions to Team Joe, including Carmen Torres and Reverend Joe Parramore.\n\"I am incredibly proud and motivated by this group of leaders that represent the diversity and size of the state and all coming together for the candidate we know who can win Florida: Joe Biden,\" said Jackie Lee, Florida Senior Advisor, Biden for President. \"To win here, we need a broad and diverse coalition that reaches every community in every corner of our state.

Continuing to mobilize women across the Sunshine State will be essential to beating Trump here in November,\" said former Congresswoman Gwen Graham, co-chair of Florida Women Leaders for Biden. \"Florida women have faced an onslaught of anti-women legislation from Tallahassee to Washington — and they deserve a candidate who can deliver for them. That's Joe Biden. He has the track record results and ability to achieve real, progressive change that Florida women and this country need. With the stakes so high, I am more motivated than ever to organize women on behalf of the candidate I know is best-positioned to beat Donald Trump in Florida and nationwide.\"\n\"Joe Biden has proven himself to be the candidate best-positioned to build the broad, diverse coalition of support that is required to win here in Florida.

Because we can beat him and will beat him in November 2020,\" said Carmen Torres, co-chair of Florida Hispanic Leaders for Biden. \"This fight is personal.

I know first hand from my experiences growing up poor what a struggling working family looks like and I know the issues that matter to them. My parents always taught me that with hard work, a good education, and faith in God, I could accomplish anything. I wish it were still that way today.\n\"Our current President has made so many promises to hard working Americans that he has failed to deliver on. The American dream is slipping further and further away for many families and leaving behind many children. Vice President Biden has never forgotten his roots and has worked to deliver on the issues that hard working families care about from his time on City Council, all the way to the Senate and the White House. He understands that a quality education, access to affordable health care, and economic opportunities are essential in creating a pathway to the middle-class. I know as president he will ensure that no one is left behind — and that's why I'm proud to endorse him for President.\"\nCongresswoman Sylvia Garcia is the first Latina to represent the 29th Congressional District of Texas, the first Latino member of the Houston Congressional Delegation, and one of the first two Latinas ever elected to Congress from the great state of Texas. Congresswoman Garcia sits on the House Judiciary Committee and Financial Services Committee. Previous to serving in Congress, Congresswoman Garcia has a long history of public service, serving as Presiding Judge of the Houston Municipal System, City Controller, County Commissioner, and then being elected to the Texas State Senate where she was the third Hispanic woman to serve in the upper chamber.\nCongresswoman Garcia's endorsement adds to the list of Latino leaders from Texas backing Biden and speaks to the campaign's successful Latino political outreach efforts, which has resulted in garnering over 100 endorsements from Latino leaders nationwide.\nAdditionally, Garcia's endorsement sheds light on why Vice President Biden is the best candidate for the state of Texas, the city of Houston, and the Latino community. It is his commitment to the state and the Latino community that has allowed him to develop a solid foundation of support both within Texas, a critical Super Tuesday and battleground state, and with Latinos. Joe Biden continues to lead the presidential field in Congressional Hispanic Caucus endorsements including endorsements from Texas Representatives Filemon Vela and Vicente Gonzalez.\nBiden has also earned the support of Texas Hispanic leaders and organizations including the Texas' Tejano Democrats, State Representative Victoria Neave, State Representative and Chair of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus Rafael Anchia, and State Senator José Menéndez. With 32 million Latinos eligible to vote this election, Latinos will be the largest non-white voting bloc this election. The road to the White House will in part depend on mobilizing the Latino community and the endorsements from these prominent community leaders will play a significant role in affirming the Latino community's support for Vice President Biden.\nBiden for President has previously announced more than 1,400 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.\n",

Today's announcement brings Vice President Biden's support to more than 50 key leaders in Virginia.\nEarlier this week, Valerie Biden Owens, Joe Biden's sister and longtime advisor, stumped for Biden, launching the Virginia portion of the \"Soul of the Nation Tour\" and delivering remarks at the Democratic Party of Virginia's Blue Commonwealth Gala. These endorsements and events demonstrate the growing support for Biden in the Commonwealth.\n\"If we're serious about repairing the fabric of our communities and restoring opportunity in America, we need to start by electing leaders like Joe Biden who can unite us behind a common goal of propelling this country forward,\" said Virginia State Senator Lynwood W.

We need Joe Biden in the White House to lead by example,\" said Norfolk City Treasurer Duan Hester. \"Just as he's done his entire career, Joe will fight for policies that invest in the quality education opportunities that will equip our next generation of leaders, that demonstrate the dignity of every worker to reduce poverty and strengthen the middle class, and that will help make sure working families can thrive.\"\n\"America needs leadership that understands what the soul of this country is all about — that respecting the dignity of every person, no matter where they come from, is paramount. That's Joe Biden,\" said Herinco County Supervisor Reverend Tyrone Nelson of Sixth Mount Zion Baptist Church. \"For too long under President Trump, our country has strayed from the kind of decency we value in Henrico County and that Joe Biden has exemplified his entire career in public service. Joe is the only candidate who can not only beat Donald Trump, but who can restore our moral leadership in the White House and around the globe on day one.\"\n\"Guaranteeing the human right of health care requires more than just words. Joe Biden understands that firsthand — it's how he helped deliver the Affordable Care Act, and it's why as president, he's committed to delivering affordable, quality care for everyone — regardless of who you are or where you come from,\" said Community Activist Leni Gonalez. \"Individuals and families faced with dire circumstances can't wait for party infighting to subside or for our politics to become less polarized.

    "text": "\nToday, the Latino Victory Fund, a national organization committed to electing Latino leaders up and down the ballot, issued the following press release endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:\nLatino Victory Fund Announces Endorsement of Vice President Joe Biden for President of the United States\nLatino Victory Fund is the first national Latino organization to endorse Vice President Joe Biden for president.\nLas Vegas, NV -- Latino Victory Fund announced the endorsement of Vice President Joe Biden for president of the United States. Vice President Biden has a history of working with the Latino community through his decades of service and is committed to introducing a comprehensive immigration bill in the first week of his administration. A recent poll conducted by Telemundo indicates that Vice President Biden is among the top candidates preferred by Nevada's Latino voters.\n\"In January 2021, there will be no learning curve for the next president of the United States. Our country will need an experienced leader who will hit the ground running on day one, and that candidate is Vice President Biden,\" said Luis A. Miranda, Jr., chair of Latino Victory. \"Vice President Biden has consistently supported issues that align with the Latino community, including access to quality, affordable health care, job growth, and a prosperous economy, access to higher education and reducing gun violence. He is committed to introducing and fighting for legislative immigration reform, including the protections of the Dream Act, within the first week of a Biden Administration. Latinos will rest assured knowing that they'll once again have an ally in the White House.\"\nMiranda, Jr. added: \"President Trump has enacted policies that do nothing to help our families get ahead. In fact, he has constantly attacked and denigrated our community, emboldening white supremacists to commit heinous crimes against Latinos like the El Paso mass shooting last year. Vice President Biden will not only support Latino issues but will work hard to heal our country and restore dignity and principles of good governance back into the Oval Office. Biden is a battle-tested leader who is in the best position to defeat Donald Trump. Latino Victory is proud to endorse Vice President Biden for president of the United States.\"\nThe Latino Victory Fund is a progressive political organization working to grow Latino political power by increasing Latino representation at every level of government. From school boards to the U.S. Senate, to the White House, Latino Victory identifies, recruits, and develops candidates for public office while building a permanent base of Latino donors to support them. For a national office, meaning President or Vice President of the United States, the Latino Victory Fund can endorse non-Latino candidates who have demonstrated an especially broad base of support among the Latino community. The reason behind this exception is because of the visibility of these offices and the importance of maximizing Latino political power nationwide.\n",

    "text": "\nKingmaker of South Carolina Politics: \"I'm calling on you to stand with Joe Biden.\"\nToday, South Carolina Congressman Jim Clyburn announced he is endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States, boosting Biden's strong campaign in the Palmetto State three days ahead of the nation's First in the South primary. Congressman Clyburn, the House's third-ranking Democrat and Majority Whip, is known as the kingmaker of South Carolina politics and gives Biden one of the most influential endorsements in South Carolina, and one that will reverberate throughout the state.\nIn announcing his endorsement, Clyburn released a video outlining why he is supporting Biden. Below is a full transcript of the video:\n\"Hello. I'm Congressman Jim Clyburn. We South Carolinians believe one thing: the best way to tell what a person will do is to look at what he or she has done.\n\"I know Joe Biden. I know his character, his heart, and his record. Joe Biden has stood for the hard-working people of South Carolina. We know Joe. But more importantly, he knows us.\n\"Joe will build on President Obama's legacy, protect and expand the Affordable Care Act, and take on the NRA.\n\"In South Carolina, we choose presidents. When President Clinton came to South Carolina, we launched him to the White House. When President Obama came to South Carolina, we launched him to the White House. Now Joe Biden is in South Carolina, and we are going to launch him to the White House.\n\"I'm calling on you to stand with Joe Biden.\"\nCongressman Clyburn is Biden's 19th Congressional Black Caucus endorsement and 44th Congressional endorsement. Clyburn is also the fourth CBC Chair to endorse Biden. Clyburn also previously served as the Chair of the House Democratic Caucus. Throughout his service in Congress, Clyburn has spearheaded legislation on important rural and economic issues, giving voice to hard-working South Carolinaians for more than two decades. His widely known 10-20-30 federal funding formula was incorporated into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act — a key achievement of the Obama-Biden Administration– and was included in the Biden Plan for Investing in Our Communities through Housing.\nCongressman Clyburn tops off Biden's long list of influential supporters in the Palmetto State, which includes more than 180 leaders such as the state's last two Democratic governors, Jim Hodges and Richard \"Dick\" Riley; state lawmakers, mayors, community activists, pastors and faith leaders, and local elected officials. Biden's diverse and broad coalition also consists of nearly 200 members of South Carolina Educators for Biden and more than 100 members of South Carolina Women for Biden from every region of the state.\nBiden for President has previously announced more than 1,400 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.\n ",

Paul LePage, we need a leader in the White House who can bring people together to restore faith in our institutions after this failed President.

    "text": "\nToday, former NASA administrator and astronaut Major General Charles Bolden released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:\n\"I am overjoyed today to second the endorsement of Vice President Joe Biden by our South Carolina Elder Statesman Congressman James Clyburn. After being part of the Obama-Biden administration— an administration that demonstrated the values that make this country strong and great, I have watched the current administration do just the opposite. Instead of fighting for working families and the middle class, Americans have been brought back into the dark ages, where racism, bigotry, and intolerance have seeped into our rhetoric and daily lives like poison.\n\"At this moment, this country needs someone in the White House that has character and vision, but the experience and know-how to course correct the damage that Trump has inflicted on this nation here at home and abroad. We also need a candidate heading the ticket who can bring along down ballot candidates like Senate candidate Jamie Harrison here in South Carolina. I believe Joe Biden is the only Presidential candidate with the executive and legislative experience to lead a strong Democratic ticket extending into our state and local elections and to step into the oval office from Day one and begin the large undertaking of cleaning up Trump's mess and moving this nation forward. As a former astronaut and administrator of NASA, I can safely say the sky is the limit for Joe Biden and what he can help this nation accomplish.\"\nMajor General Charles Bolden Jr., a native South Carolinian, served as the 12th Administrator and the first African American Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Previous to serving in the Obama-Biden administration, Bolden had a 34 year career with the Marine Corps which included 14 years as a member of NASA's Astronaut office. During his time as an astronaut he led two missions and piloted two others including the deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope, the historic first U.S.-Russian shuttle mission, Space Shuttle Columbia, and Space Shuttle Atlantis— resulting in 680 hours logged in space. Bolden's father, Charles Bolden Sr. was a well-known high school football coach of C.A. Johnson High School in Columbia, South Carolina. C.A. Johnson High School was not only Major General Bolden's alma mater, but was only one of two all-black schools in Columbia, South Carolina at the time. In honor of his father's legacy, C.A. Johnson High School named their football stadium after Charles Bolden Sr.\nFollowing House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn's endorsement yesterday, Bolden's endorsement builds on the strength and momentum that Vice President Biden has garnered in the African American community and South Carolina.\nBiden for President has previously announced more than 1,400 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.\n",

    "text": "\nPanetta Becomes Ninth Obama-Biden Cabinet Member to Endorse Joe Biden\nToday, former Secretary of the Defense, Congressman, CIA Director, and White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:\n\"Our nation stands at the most critical pivot point in recent history. Will we remain mired in the polarization and political dysfunction; or will we emerge from this moment of crisis stronger, more unified, and more committed to the value and ideals of the United States?\n\"This is the central question of our time – and the answer depends on who we elect to be our President in November.\n\"On Tuesday, when my fellow Californians and I go to the polls, I will be voting for Joe Biden.\n\"I have known Joe Biden since the mid-1970s when I was first elected to Congress and he was serving in the Senate. For more than four decades, I have worked with him and seen his principled leadership in action.\n\"When I was President Clinton's Chief of Staff, then-Senator Biden led the fight for civil rights, common sense gun safety, equality for women, and protection of the environment. When I was President Obama's CIA Director and Secretary of Defense, I saw then-Vice President Biden's immense experience and keen judgment in national security affairs. He was respected by our allies and feared by our adversaries. And, he cared deeply about our troops, intelligence professionals, diplomats, and their families. Both he and I had sons deploy to the warzones after 9/11. We shared the worry of the many families whose loved ones are deployed in harm's way.\n\"Joe Biden is unquestionably the most qualified individual to be President. He knows and understands the responsibilities of being President. He does not need on-the-job training. He has a proven record of fighting for working class Americans, pursuing equality for all, expanding health care accessibility, protecting our environment, and supporting strong American leadership in the world. At a time when we are facing serious threats abroad, he will rebuild our alliances, support not undermine military discipline, restore American credibility and deterrence, bolster our cyber defenses, invest in the readiness of our diplomats and our troops, listen to our intelligence professionals, and stand up to dictators like Putin and Kim Jong Un.\n\"Above all, Joe Biden will work to heal our nation from this era of polarization, bring us together as one America, unify our country so that we can work together to govern and solve the difficult problems we confront. We cannot afford four more years of hate and anger and gridlock. Joe's honesty, decency and respect for every human being is what this nation needs now more than ever.\n\"I urge all Californians to vote for Joe Biden on Tuesday.\"\nPanetta is the 9th Obama-Biden Cabinet Secretary to endorse Biden. He served as a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing the Central Coast of California, White House Budget Director and White House Chief of Staff under President Clinton, and CIA Director and Secretary of Defense under President Obama. Additionally, Panetta is the recipient of many awards including the National Defense Industrial Association's Dwight D. Eisenhower Award, the California Teachers Association's Friends of Education Award, the Judicial Council of California's Stanley Mosk Defender of Justice Award and many more.\nSecretary Panetta's endorsement is indicative of the unwavering confidence the national security community and elected officials have in Joe Biden's step into the role of Commander-In-Chief and prioritize the United State's national security.\nBiden for President has previously announced more than 1,400 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.\n",

    "text": "\nToday, former North Carolina Congressman and State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Bob Etheridge released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for the President of the United States:\n\"Every election is important, but the upcoming one might be the most consequential in our lifetime. Issues that matter most to families in North Carolina, like education, health care, and our standing in the world with our allies, have decidedly not been at the forefront of our nation's agenda. I can't recall a more dire time to change this trajectory.\n\"The good news is, we have a candidate who has not only committed his entire career to creating opportunities for hardworking families in America, but has a proven track record of making progress on the issues that matter most to them. When I had the great honor of serving my fellow North Carolinians in Congress I worked alongside then-Vice President Biden to improve access to health care in rural communities, expand funding for public education, and ensure that economical and agricultural issues important to my home state of North Carolina and the entire country, were always a part of the conversation.\n\"In 2020, we must hit the ground running to unite our country and rebuild the middle class. We cannot afford a person in the White House who needs on the job training. Americans have witnessed what that does to our standing in the world over the last three years. What we need is a stable hand – someone with a big heart, a clear vision, and a record of working across the aisle to solve some of the biggest issues facing our nation. We need a leader who can help put us back on the right track because our children and grandchildren's futures depend on it.\n\"That's why, as families in North Carolina and across the country head to the polls this week and in weeks to come, I ask my fellow Americans to think about what is at stake. This election will determine the direction that our state and our country are going to take. I want someone who is experienced, someone who I have worked with to produce results for our communities, and someone who understands not just the rule and nature of North Carolina, but the heart of the people who live here: we care about our communities, our neighbors, and our country. That person is Joe Biden. Today, I am proud to endorse my friend and former colleague for President of the United States.\"\nJoe Biden has the support of all three Democratic U.S. House members in North Carolina and more endorsements in the Tar Heel State than any other Democratic candidate. This includes the support of 25 current and former elected officials in North Carolina, including mayors, state lawmakers, city, and county officials, candidates for office, local activists, both members of North Carolina's Congressional Black Caucus: Congressman G. K. Butterfield and Congresswoman Alma Adams, and Chair of the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus, Paul Lowe. Earlier this month, Biden received the endorsement of Anthony Foxx, former Secretary of Transportation and mayor of Charlotte.\nBiden for President has previously announced more than 1,400 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.\n",

But as this South Carolina primary comes to a close, I believe that one of these candidates truly stands out, as both an experienced national leader and a thoroughly decent human being — and that's former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\"For more than four decades, Joe Biden has provided strong, steady leadership on the greatest issues facing our country — from the economy and civil rights, to foreign policy and national defense, to climate change and health care and more. In fact, it's almost impossible to imagine a more capable, qualified candidate for our nation's highest office.\n\"Moreover, in recent days, as a member of our extended Tecklenburg family has been forced to cope with a significant health issue, we've gotten to see just a glimpse of the simple human decency that Joe Biden would bring to the White House. And to put it plainly, we've been deeply moved by the thought of what that kind of caring, compassionate leadership could mean for our country.\n\"And so today, I want to urge my fellow Charlestonians and South Carolinians to join me in voting for Joe Biden.

    "text": "\n[As prepared for delivery. See video below for remarks as delivered.]\nThank you, South Carolina!\nWe are back!\nTo all those who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind: This is your campaign.\nJust days ago the press and the pundits had declared this candidacy dead.\nNow, thanks to you — the heart of the Democratic Party — we haven't just won. We won big, and we are very much alive.\nAnd the state that launched Bill Clinton and Barack Obama to the presidency has now launched our campaign on the path to defeating Donald Trump.\nThis campaign is taking off, so join us. Go to JoeBiden.com – sign up, volunteer, contribute if you can.\nWe need you. We want you. There's a place for you in our campaign.\nBut as we celebrate tonight here in Columbia, let me speak directly to Democrats across the nation, especially to those voting on Super Tuesday.\nThe moment to choose the path forward for our party has arrived. Maybe sooner than anyone guessed or wanted. But it's here.\nAnd the decisions Democrats make all across America in the next few days will determine what this party stands for, what we believe, and what we will get done.\nIf Democrats want a nominee who can beat Trump, keep Nancy Pelosi as Speaker, and hold the House — and take the U.S. Senate and state legislatures — Join us.\nIf Democrats want a nominee who will build on Obamacare, not scrap it; take on the NRA and the gun manufacturers, not protect them; stand up for the middle class, not raise their taxes and make promises that can't be kept — join us.\nAnd if Democrats want a nominee who is a Democrat — a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat — join us.\nWe can win big or lose big. That's the choice.\nWe need to build on the coalition and legacy of the most successful president of our lifetime: Barack Obama.\nAnd we do this by bringing together Americans of every race, ethnicity, gender, and economic station — Democrats, Republicans, and Independents of every stripe.\nLike we did right here in South Carolina.\nLike we can do across the entire country on Tuesday and beyond.\nWin big or lose big. That's the choice.\nMost Americans don't want the promise of a revolution. They want results.\nThey want to give all Americans access to real opportunity — to have affordable and available health care for all Americans.\nAn environment with clean air and clean water; an education system that funds our schools, pays our teachers, and makes community college free; a nation where we stand up to and beat the NRA; reform our criminal justice system; and mobilize the world against climate change.\nAn economy that rewards work not just wealth — a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about dignity, decency, respect. It's about your place in the community.\nFor all of our families. For all of our communities.\nBecause it's the right thing to do.\nWe're Democrats.\nTalk is cheap.\nFalse promises are deceptive. And talk of a revolution isn't changing anyone's life.\nYou need real results right now.\nI've done that my whole career. And I'll do it as President.\nSo, this isn't the election to spend all our time on a battle for the soul of the Democratic Party.\nThis is a battle for the soul of America.\nAnd in this most perilous moment, winning means uniting America, not sowing more division and anger.\nIt means not only fighting but healing this country. We must beat Donald Trump and the Republican Party — but we can't become them.\nWe must heal our divisions and repair our democracy.\nAbove all, it's time for America to get back up.\nAnd once again, fight for the proposition that we hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men and women are created equal. Endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights.\nWe've never lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it.\nI believe that with every fiber of my being.\nI saw it a few days ago at a town hall in Charleston.\nI spoke with Reverend Anthony Thompson whose wife, Myra, was studying the words of her bible with eight other parishioners of Mother Emanuel four-and-half years ago.\nIt was their weekly routine — reading scripture and finding purpose in faith in God and in each other.\nIn an instant, hate's vengeance pierced their faith, lost forever.\nBut what's remarkable about Reverend Thompson and the families of the \"Emanuel 9\" is that through their pain and grief — they forgave.\nAnd in their forgiveness, change that had been fought for over 100 years in South Carolina occurred.\nThe Confederate flag came down and real change began to take place.\nThat's why I came back to Mother Emanuel on Sunday services after the funerals for the victims. Because six weeks earlier, we had lost our son Beau, and we needed to be healed.\nAnd with every day of every season that has passed, they have gotten up and found purpose to live a life worthy of their loved ones — worthy of the blessing to live in this remarkable country of ours.\nYou're the reason I'm in this race. People like you here tonight and all around the country.\nThe days of Donald Trump's divisiveness are soon to be over. We can build a more perfect union, because the American people have seen the alternative.\nTo all of you here in South Carolina — and especially to Jim Clyburn, my friend —\nyou lifted me and this campaign on your shoulders.\nI will never forget what you have done for us.\nAnd we need to stand behind Jaime Harrison – the next United States Senator from South Carolina.\nAnd we need to send Joe Cunningham back to the House of Representatives.\nTo the loves of my life, Jill and Ashley. Thank you for everything.\nFolks, so let's get back up.\nWe are decent, brave, and resilient people.\nWe can believe again.\nWe are better than this moment!\nWe are better than this president!\nSo get up!\nTake back our country!\nWe are the United States of America!\nThere is nothing we can't do – if we do it together!\nMay God Bless you all.\nMay God protect our troops.\n",

And at a time of rising hate as we saw in Charlottesville, we need Joe Biden's character and decency to repair the damage that Trump's rhetoric has done to our country.\n\"In Virginia, we've taken our state from red to blue in a decade by running campaigns that appeal to the majority of voters on issues like lowering health care costs, raising wages, and improving education.

Joe knows the issues facing our communities in Arkansas. When I served in the U.S. Senate, I watched Joe fight for what was right and I was proud to work alongside him to solve issues that working families are facing. He's represented our nation on the world stage. I traveled to Iraq with him to visit our Arkansas soldier and saw in person the respect leaders in other countries have for him. He fought to get the Affordable Care Act passed that helped more than 70,000 Arkansans and their families gain access to quality, affordable health insurance and provides critical protections for Arkansans living with pre-existing conditions. And he helped lead our nation's recovery from one of the worst recessions since the Great Depression by working across the aisle and making the hard decisions.\n\"In Arkansas, uncertainty created by unpredictable trade wars has upended our agricultural economy and the constant threat of losing health care coverage for preexisting conditions has caused unnecessary anxiety among patients and medical providers. This ends with Joe Biden.\n\"I adore Joe and Jill Biden. Steve and I will never forget their kindness and support when we arrived in the US Senate in 1999 with twin two year olds and a full schedule of work, family and all that young families face! Jill will be a tremendous First Lady. And Joe will assemble a White House staff and cabinet who respect the Constitution and who know how to address our nation's most critical needs.

Democrats must counter his bad character by nominating a man with heart, strength, and a steady hand.\n\"Joe Biden is a statesman who has been tested by years of public service as a Senator and as the Vice President and most trusted counselor of President Barack Obama. He has the experience necessary to achieve progress and deliver results, and the ability to unite our party's broad coalition and lead us to victory in November. As Virginians weigh their choices in Tuesday's primary, I give my endorsement to Vice President Joe Biden.\"\nCongressman Beyer adds to the flood of high-profile endorsements Biden has earned from Virginia leaders in recent days, including former Governor Terry McAuliffe, Senator Tim Kaine, and Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton, and Congressman Bobby Scott. He also joins more than 50 leaders from across the state backing Biden, including Congressman Donald McEachin, Congresswoman Elaine Luria, Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, Roanoke Mayor Sherman Lea, Virginia State Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, and other state legislators and local leaders.\nLast November, Biden endorsed 23 local candidates in some of the most competitive districts ahead of Virginia's General Assembly elections, helping turn both legislative chambers blue. In 2018, he also worked to elect candidates up and down the ballot in Virginia, including now-Reps. Abigail Spanberger, Jennifer Wexton, and Elaine Luria, whose wins in critical Red to Blue districts helped Democrats take back the U.S. House.\nBiden for President has previously announced more than 1,400 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.\n",

In this presidential election, we face another key crossroads, when we must come together to use our voices and votes to stand against the petty forces of division that would make our nation bitter and small. On Tuesday, we have to vote for the one candidate with the character, coalition, and experience to call our whole country to conscience: Joe Biden. I know Joe, and so do you – he has been fighting beside us for decades. Joe has given his life to public service, to serving something bigger than himself. As a long-time senator and as Barack Obama's trusted vice president, Joe has always fought for equal opportunity and justice. From expanding the Voting Rights Act; to getting weapons of war off our streets; to writing and passing the Violence Against Women Act, to get abuse and assault survivors the support and justice they deserve, Joe has worked to stand against the abuse of power wherever it's found. Today, I know he is the one candidate with the experience and heart to bring our nation together to do big things – to strive for true equity in education and housing, to give every child and family a fair chance; to protect and build on Obamacare, so everyone can choose the health coverage that's best for them; and above all, to heal the divided soul of our nation, and bring us together to start meeting our true potential to make the American Dream real for everyone.\"\nSeawright is a preacher, teacher, author, and community leaders who has led nonprofits and ministries across Alabama, Maryland, and abroad in assignments for the US Agency for International Development and the US Defense Intelligence Agency.

    "text": "\nBuilding on the momentum coming out of Super Tuesday, former Michigan Senator Carl Levin released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:\n\"Like many Democrats in Michigan and across the country, I have struggled with the question of which Democratic presidential candidate has the best chance of defeating Donald Trump this November. All the Democratic candidates would be superior to four more years of endless Trump lies and divisiveness and incivility. All would end Trump's relentless injection of venom against those who disagree with him and his endless elevation of his personal interest and ego above the interests of the nation.\n\"I have concluded that Vice President Joe Biden has the best chance of defeating Donald Trump – and the best chance of winning Michigan's electoral votes.\n\"First, Joe Biden has the best chance of attracting votes of a broad cross-section of voters in Michigan and across the country, including some moderate voters who might vote for Trump or might not vote at all, rather than voting for a self-described socialist such as Sen. Bernie Sanders whose ideology is unappealing to those voters.\n\"Second, a major issue for me is the health of our auto industry, which accounts directly or indirectly for one in 10 jobs in our country. Joe Biden has a demonstrated record of standing up for auto workers, while Bernie Sanders at a critical moment for the industry's survival did not.\n\"When the future of that industry was in doubt in 2008 and 2009, and big parts of the industry were in danger of going under in a tail spinning economy, Joe Biden was in the trenches as a senator and as Vice President-elect, fighting for and voting – along with my brother Sandy and I – for the bill that would contain the $19 billion that the industry needed to survive. Twice in the Senate, Joe Biden took tough votes that provided the assistance. Both he and then-Sen. Obama voted on Oct. 1, 2008 – in the midst of their heated presidential campaign – for the Troubled Asset Relief Program that provided that assistance to the auto industry and to financial markets. They did so even though a Republican president had requested the aid. Bernie Sanders voted no.\n\"The second key vote providing funding to save our auto industry came on Jan. 15, 2009. Obama was now the President-elect and Biden was the Vice President-elect. It was only five days before their inauguration. President Bush had authorized $13.5 billion of TARP funds to help the auto industry survive. But the law creating TARP divided the rescue program in half and set up a Congressional vote on the second half of the aid – including $4 billion in crucial aid to the auto industry. Obama and Biden pushed hard for approval, despite continued controversy over the aid. Once again, they were there for auto workers when it mattered. Sanders voted to disapprove the funding.\n\"If Bernie Sanders is our nominee, I foresee Trump, despite his own inconsistencies on support for the auto industry, would make a powerful media pitch that if Sanders had his way on those two key votes, much of the domestic auto industry would have gone under.\n\"I worked with Joe Biden for 30 years. I know personally of the facts that I am recounting here because I was there in person on the floor of the Senate when he cast those tough votes. By the time of that second vote in January 2009, 17,000 Americans a day were losing their jobs and more than 9,000 homes were going into foreclosure every day in our country. Joe Biden was taking practical steps to stop those losses, while Bernie Sanders was taking an ideological position. Both are good men and have good hearts and care about working people. But it was Biden who fought for us and acted effectively at a critical moment to bring those job losses and foreclosures to an end and to provide immediate and practical support for our critical auto industry here in Michigan. Biden's experience in foreign affairs will help restore America's role as a coalition builder and as a moral force in the world. With those qualities and with his more broad-based appeal I believe he has the best chance of defeating Trump in Michigan and helping our state and nation to get back on track.\"\nLevin's endorsement adds to the growing support that Joe Biden has already garnered in Michigan, including former Governor Jennifer Granholm who endorsed earlier today. In addition, the Michigan Democratic Party Black Caucus, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, State Representatives Joe Tate, Karen Whitsett, and Tenisha Yancey, and State Senator Marshall Bullock have also endorsed Biden. Nationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.\n",

    "text": "\nAfter exceeding all expectations on Super Tuesday, Illinois Members of Congress Mike Quigley, Robin Kelly, and Bill Foster released the following statements endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:\n\"In Chicago, we know something about toughness and resilience, and nobody embodies that spirit more than Joe Biden,\" said Congressman Mike Quigley. \"On all the issues that matter most in our community, Joe has been fighting beside us for decades. Whether investing big on infrastructure that grows our economy and creates millions of good jobs, supporting commonsense solutions that will end the epidemic of gun violence, or restoring American leadership in the world to keep our nation safe at home, Joe is the only candidate in the race with the experience, heart and vision to unite America and move us forward.\"\n\"Joe Biden is the candidate of compassion and strength that our divided nation so badly needs,\" said Congresswoman Robin Kelly. \"Joe has given his life to public service, and has the heart and smarts to bring us together now to get things done. I know, because I know Joe – you do, too. During the Obama administration, I worked up-close with him on a blueprint for ending our nation's gun violence epidemic; today, Joe is the one presidential candidate with the experience and broad coalition to get it done. Joe has spent years not just fighting for common sense gun reforms – beating the NRA twice: passing a 10-year assault weapons ban and Brady Bill background checks – but funding and promoting community policing, to help rebuild so many broken bonds of trust in neighborhoods nationwide. As president, Joe will bring that quest to heal to our whole nation, fighting for equity in housing, healthcare, and education, and to rebuild the middle class and make sure everyone has the same sure path to a bright future.\"\n\"Today more than ever, our nation is reminded how crucial it is to have a president who believes in facts, science, and reason; who knows how to bring people together in times of crisis; and who can draw on a deep well of experience to revive the enterprising spirit and openness that has always kept this country safe and strong,\" said Congressman Bill Foster. \"As a kid who started his own company at 19, as a physicist, and as the proud representative of Illinois's 11th Congressional District, I know that Joe Biden will be that kind of president. I know because I worked up close with him throughout the depths of the Great Recession, and I saw him push job-saving, life-saving bills through Congress, with a steady hand and a big heart. I joined him in working to protect consumers and to fight to pass the Affordable Care Act. I know he'll continue that work and so much more as president, investing in a clean energy economy, in game-changing medical research, and in rebuilding the middle class for every working family.\"\nEarlier this week, Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth became the seventh U.S. Senator to endorse Biden — the most of any candidate in the race. Today's slate also join Congressman Brad Schneider (IL-10), Congressman Danny Davis (IL-7), and former Senator and Ambassador Carol Moseley Braun.\nLast week, Biden for President announced the support of 82 Illinois leaders from all 18 congressional districts. Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.\n",

Both Trump and Vladimir Putin would prefer to see Sanders as the Democratic nominee.\nEqually important to his policies, Biden's personality and character make him the best candidate for this perilous time.\nWidely experienced. Thoroughly decent. Ideologically moderate. If Joe Biden is not a man for all seasons, he is certainly the man of the hour.\nWe are proud to endorse Joe Biden for the presidency of the United States.\nTampa Bay Times: Editorial: Times recommends: Joe Biden for Democrats\n...As both political parties tilt toward their extremes, Biden could steer the country toward the middle with a steady hand.\nHe knows how to make government work for the greater good, and he has collaborated with Republicans and Democrats alike...\nBiden takes positions that are progressive and possible.\nHe would pursue universal health coverage by building on the Affordable Care Act, not by pushing a government takeover that Congress won't approve and Americans won't support. He was an early leader on climate change and embraces aggressive goals, but he would not immediately ban fracking that extracts natural gas. He would forgive student loan debt in exchange for public service and suggests two years of community college could be free, but he does not call for all student loan debt to be magically wiped away or embrace the fantasy of entirely free tuition at public colleges and universities…\nThe Super Tuesday results also demonstrate Biden can boost voter turnout, particularly among blacks, women and suburban voters.\nBiden's mainstream approach and personal decency could appeal to Republican and independent voters seeking an alternative to the incumbent in November.\n",

That healthcare law was the first major reform since Medicare and Medicaid passed in the mid-1960s. It's time to build on that reform, not discard it. Joe has a real plan to lower costs, increase choice and competition, and get every American the health care coverage they deserve — right away.\n\"At this time of an emerging health crisis, it's more important than ever to have an experienced leader as president who listens to the scientists, believes in health care for all, and can bring the country together to deal with the challenges ahead.\n\"That leader is Joe Biden, and I hope you'll join me in fighting for him.\"\nSecretary Sebelius joins nine other former members of President Barack Obama's cabinet in endorsing Biden, affirming the Vice President's role as a skilled leader and trusted partner to our 44th president, and building on his historic, strong showing on Super Tuesday this week.\nBiden for President has previously announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.\n",

Specifically, we were looking for the candidate whose experience, vision, realistic approach to foreign policy, electability and demonstrated ability to identify areas of broad public consensus rose above his or her rivals'. Judged by those five metrics, Biden is the clear winner. His resume is distinguished by both its length and its breadth.

Like his nuanced views on crimes and drug addiction, his pragmatic approach to foreign policy is born of long and sometimes painful experience… It's difficult to imagine a U.S, ally who would not be reassured by Biden's election, or an adversary who would mistake it as an invitation to military aggression or nuclear mischief.\"\n\"Biden would bring to the White House an agenda far more ambitious than the one Obama realized or even articulated. Though Biden wisely declined to embrace the chimeric prescription for universal Medicare (a non-starter in any conceivable Congress), he has expressed support for many of the financial reforms proposed by Warren. Like Warren's platform, Biden's would shift power from Wall Street to consumers, entrepreneurs and workers.\"\n\"We worry, especially, that a ticket helmed by Sanders' nomination would jeopardize the re-election of U.S. Reps. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) and Haley Stevens (D-Troy), who won seats in historically red congressional districts. And the trust and goodwill Biden enjoys on Capitol Hill boost the odds that he will be able to break the partisan gridlock that has doomed bipartisan progress on immigration reform, gun violence, and climate change.\"\n\"Biden, by contrast, has somehow made his way through half a century without vilifying broad segments of the American electorate. His decency and empathy are authentic. So is his humility, which grew organically from his personal experience with error, disappointment and familial tragedy.\"\n\"Still, Biden's manifest resilience and capacity for self-healing bode well for the gargantuan task of restoring decency, competence and credibility to the White House. No Democrat, Republican or third-party loyalist need fear him; his election would imperil only the poisonous mixture of cynicism, contempt and distrust that pervade American political life in the age of Donald Trump.\"\nThe Detroit News: Joe Biden is Democrats' best choice in Michigan presidential primary\n\"Democratic voters consistently tell pollsters their priority in the presidential primaries is nominating a candidate who can beat President Donald Trump this fall. Of the contenders who remain in the race heading into Tuesday's Michigan balloting, Joe Biden best meets that criteria. In fact, the former vice president may be the only one who can fulfill the Democratic desire to deny Trump a second term.\"\n\"One of the country's major challenges is the ever-growing political divide. The inability of those in Washington to work across party lines and the increasing incivility in the public square are the biggest threats to the nation's well-being… Biden, as a U.S. senator and vice president, has a reputation as someone who could build consensus. His former boss, President Barack Obama, called on him often to knit the two parties together on important matters.\"\n\"Further recommending Biden is his White House experience. He served eight years under Obama, and was involved in many of the major decisions, for better or worse, made by the administration.\"\n\"This election is unfolding in a period of great uncertainty. No one knows how much damage the coronavirus is going to do to the nation's health and economy. Biden has the experience to navigate difficult decisions necessary to confront the crisis, and the ability to rise above partisanship to do what's best for the American people.\"\n",

In their endorsement of Vice President Biden the Post cited his \"big and open heart\" and lauded Biden as the candidate with \"the best chance of helping down-ballot candidates.\"\nThe Palm Beach Post: Post endorsements: Biden is best choice for Democratic presidential nomination\nPost endorsement in the Democratic presidential primary.\nJust one thing should be on the minds of Florida Democrats as they vote in the March 17 presidential primary: How to beat Donald Trump in November.\nThat means picking the candidate who, even if not your first choice during this long campaign season, is the best bet to win.\nThat choice has become much easier after the clarifying events of the past week. In rapid fashion, the fire that started in South Carolina and roared through Super Tuesday has culled the recently unwieldy Democratic field to just two leading contenders.\nFlorida ? and its 219 delegates ? is now positioned to have a substantial say in naming the nominee.\nThey should choose Joseph R. Biden.\nThe Palm Beach Post Editorial Board is endorsing the former vice president because, in our judgment, he has a far better chance than Sen. Bernie Sanders of winning the key battleground states ? not just in the primaries to come, but in November. In Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania.\nAnd of course, Florida. Democrats would, for all intents and purposes, cede the Sunshine State's 29 electoral votes to the Republicans with Sanders as their standard bearer. Between the self-proclaimed \"Democratic socialist's\" ill-informed comments about Cuban dictator Fidel Castro and public snub of AIPAC (American-Israel Public Affairs Committee), Sanders would essentially start out in a huge electoral hole.\nBiden has the best chance of helping down-ballot candidates for Senate, U.S. House and state legislatures, which Democrats desperately need to gain even an inch of the progress that every Democrat, including Sanders supporters, wishes to see.\nWith Biden, none of those candidates will be burdened with a \"socialist\" label to defend. Instead, competitive races in states like Arizona, Maine and Colorado will give Democrats a real shot of flipping the Senate.\nAnd that will be absolutely vital, not just to progressive legislation, but more importantly, to the appointment of federal judges. This is how Democratic voters see to it that the clock is not rolled back on health care, abortion rights, voting rights, workers' rights and environmental protection.\nBiden has the best chance of increasing turnout from the center and center-left of the Democratic Party. Ironically, unprecedented turnout was supposed to be Sanders' strength. But the promised surge of first-time voters hasn't materialized in the primaries, except maybe in California. On the contrary, ever since South Carolina, it is Biden who has inspired Democrats to swell the voting totals.\nBiden has the best chance of unifying the party and the nation. Sanders and his supporters are admirably fervent ? but leave little room for the less-than-fervent. As one longtime Florida Democrat told the Post Editorial Board: \"One does not build a coalition by spitting in the eye of party leaders, calling people names who don't support you and accusing competitors who decide to endorse others of being unfair.\"\nBiden, on the other hand, is attracting a growing array of former rivals because they know him to be a solid team player, fully capable of building the broad coalition that it will take to defeat Trump. Biden, and only Biden, can draw in much-needed independents. And he can draw those \"future former Republicans,\" as Pete Buttigieg elegantly calls them.\n[...]\nMore important than all this, Biden has a big and open heart ? a powerful contrast to a president incapable of empathy or a deep interest in anything beyond his own personal interests. Biden has been a leader on gun control. He shepherded the Affordable Care Act for President Barack Obama. He was quicker than Obama to support same-sex marriage.\nHis longtime leadership of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee ensures that, as president, he would quickly restore America's standing among free nations while taking the world's dictators to task. He would shore up NATO and other vital alliances. He would quickly revive our membership in the Paris Climate Accords.\nSupporters of Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren who worry that their liberal dreams would be shattered by a Biden presidency, shouldn't. Biden will undoubtedly run on the most progressive platform any major party has produced since ... well, maybe ever.\nBiden will fight for the most far-reaching health-coverage law possible. He'll address climate change and fair-minded immigration policy. And while he doesn't talk much about inequality or bash the billionaire class, he'll increase taxes on the uber-wealthy and corporations just the same.\nFloridians can make a real impact in the Democratic primary process.\nThey can give Biden a convincing victory in this vital swing state. They can increase his delegate lead, and help extinguish any potential claims by the Sanders camp of being cheated out of the nomination. They can make the day come sooner that the Democratic Party unites behind the candidate that the Trump campaign fears most.\n",

    "text": "\nToday, the Chicago Sun-Times endorsed Joe Biden for President. In their endorsement of Vice President Biden, the Sun-Times cited his support for unions, ability to beat Donald Trump, impact on down-ballot candidates, and how he will govern on day one.\nChicago Sun-Times: Endorsement: Joe Biden for designated driver in a country binging on discord\n\"Thank you, Democrats, for the designated driver. We were feeling despondent about our chances of getting home safely. The guy behind the wheel now, Donald Trump, veers like a drunk all over the road of decency and values, driving into hate-filled ditches...So, yes, we were relieved on Super Tuesday when you surprised everybody, you Democrats, and voted in big numbers to give Joe Biden the keys.\"\n\"But when Biden crossed the finish line ahead of Sanders in 10 states on Tuesday, leaving him with a total of 638 pledged delegates to Sanders' 563 as of Friday morning, he defied the predictions of all the smart people and, well, the sun peeked out.\"\n\"Today, we are endorsing Biden in the March 17 Illinois primary — and every other state Democratic primary that's left — for three reasons:\n\nBiden stands the best chance of beating Trump in November. Nothing matters more than that. He is supported by a broad coalition of Democrats. Sanders had predicted a big surge in the number of voters on Tuesday and there was indeed a surge — for the other guy. African Americans, suburban women and politically moderate whites of all backgrounds voted for Biden because, as they told reporters outside polling places, Trump's gotta go.\nBiden's name at the top of the Democratic ticket... gives centrist Democrats running for Congress their best chance of winning. This is essential. We don't even want to think about what another four years of Trump would look like if the Democrats were to lose the House.\nBiden would be a better president than Sanders. He would govern in a moderately progressive manner, not unlike his old boss Barack Obama, and put together a competent crew of administrators.\n\nBiden would defend and improve the Affordable Care Act, take action to make higher education more affordable, reinstate protections for immigrants and religious minorities, take climate change seriously, address tax advantages at the heart of runaway wealth inequality, and mend relations with tried-and-true allies around the world.\"\n\"Consider one example: Biden and Sanders' competing plans to making a college education more affordable.\nBiden would make two years of community college free. He would cut — but not wipe out — student loan obligations, particularly for those who work public service jobs. He would cancel undergraduate federal student loan debt for people earning less than $25,000, and cap loan payments for everybody else at 5% of their after-tax income.\nHis plan would reduce the cost of higher education for tens of millions of Americans. More to the point, it could become reality. We can well imagine Biden wrangling the votes in a Democratic-controlled House and maybe even, given his proclivity for bipartisanship, in a Republican Senate.\"\n\"Biden is a man of compassion, honor and decency, unlike the man in the White House. Anybody can see that. And he has worked over a professional lifetime to improve in practical ways the lot of others. He worked closely with Obama to craft and make law the Affordable Care Act.\nWe can't, as a nation, keep binging on discord.\nWe're looking for a safe ride home, hoping it's still there.\nWe're happy to ride shotgun if Joe Biden is behind the wheel.\"\n",

    "text": "\nToday, less than two weeks before Florida's March 17 primary, Florida Education Association President Fedrick Ingram released the following statement in his personal capacity on Medium announcing his support for Joe Biden for President of the United States:\n\"As a high school band director who taught in and grew up in one of the poorest communities in Miami, I know firsthand about the need to see the possible, even when conditions make positive outcomes seem impossible. When you are teaching kids who have the deck stacked against them from day one, you have to see what others cannot see in that child — you have to believe that you can teach that child to believe in themselves and succeed. We need a president who believes in educators' ability to make that magic happen for our students, and is willing to partner with educators in providing all children the world-class education they deserve. That is why my choice for president is Vice President Joe Biden.\n\"I have a personal connection with Joe Biden. He often speaks of his struggles as a child with a stutter and how his teachers worked with him to boost his confidence.\n\"My own story mirrors his experience: I too had a stutter. I too had teachers who saw more in me than a kid with a speech impediment and helped me overcome the frustration and embarrassment I struggled with for years. Biden understands the value of our profession in a child's life.\n\"Joe Biden believes that every single person in this country, no matter where they start in life, can achieve if they work at it. He knows that our future depends upon a strong middle class, that is why he supports giving educators the pay and respect they deserve. He knows that something must be done to keep teachers in the classroom. In Florida we have a growing teacher shortage. We see 50 percent of teachers leaving the profession within the first five years of their careers. Biden supports investment in programs that will encourage and support our teachers so they will remain in the classroom.\nFlorida has experienced the heartbreak of several mass shootings, including the horrendous killing of 17 innocent people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Biden knows the importance of ensuring our students have access to mental health services and has promised to invest resources that will help them grow into healthy adults — both mentally and physically. He has promised to make sure our schools are safe and healthy environments for our students.\n\"Biden knows all students deserve well-resourced schools and has made a commitment to invest in innovative schools in low-income communities and communities of color. He knows that there is more to education than bubbling-in a standardized test. He knows that preparing our children for the future means learning how to solve problems and collaborate on projects and technical skills, and, closest to my heart, he knows the value of the arts and music in a child's education.\n\"I believe Biden is the best choice to right the ship.\nHe can help us move forward to build stronger schools and prepare our students for better jobs. He will work to ensure a thriving economy and healthcare that families can afford. And most importantly, he has the proven ability to help heal the wounds of an extremely divided country, and will bring stability and respect into our relationships in the global arena.\n\"Joe Biden has beaten the odds many times before. He has the faith and determination to see us through difficult times. That is why he has my full support and why I believe he is the best choice for our next president.\"\nNational unions have also endorsed Biden, including the International Association of Firefighters (IAFF), International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers (IW), Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU), Operative Plasterers' & Cement Masons' International Association (OPCMIA). Earlier this week, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1625, representing 15,000 Floridians, endorsed Biden. The American Federation of Federation of Teachers (AFT) also encouraged members to support Biden among two other candidates.\nBiden for President has previously announced more than 1,600 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.\n",

    "text": "\nToday, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick released the following statement endorsing Joe Biden for President of the United States:\n\"This is a moment of profound consequence in America. At a time when our democracy is at risk, our economy is not working for many Americans, and our role in the world is unsteady, America needs a unifying and experienced leader, who can and wants to make life better for everyone everywhere. Joe Biden is that leader. I am today proud to endorse him for the Democratic nomination for President.\n\"As Governor of Massachusetts, I worked closely with President Barack Obama and Vice President Biden. I saw firsthand Joe's essential role in passing historic health care reform, saving the American auto industry and our country from another depression, leading our troops home from war, and championing historic civil rights and LGBTQ equality. He was my go-to contact on stimulus spending, the very spending that enabled us to invest in our schools, help our students achieve nation-leading academic performance, and close achievement gaps. And his and the President's relationships with other leaders around the world paved a smoother way for our own state-level trade missions on behalf of business leaders, workers and educators.\n\"Joe Biden has been a partner of mine for many years. He chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee during the confirmation process when I was nominated to head the Civil Rights Division in the U.S. Justice Department in the Clinton administration. When Black churches and synagogues were set on fire across the South in the 1990s, and I was tasked by President Clinton to co-chair the federal Church Arson Task Force to investigate and prosecute those attacks, Joe promptly and effectively moved legislation through the Senate to provide emergency funding for our work. I worked with him and his team on judicial appointments when I was a staff attorney at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. I have known him to be a champion for vulnerable and marginalized Americans for a long time.\n\"Above all, I know Joe Biden to be a deeply empathetic man. His interest in and interactions with people, as well as his own experience with personal suffering and setbacks, and his faith, have combined to make him a genuinely caring and compassionate person. He brings those sensibilities to his work. But I can tell from the many stories I hear about him that are not a part of a legislative or foreign policy achievement, the ones from people who have encountered him on the train home from Washington to Delaware, that he sees the unseen and hears the unheard – and that sincere concern for others informs not just the kind of work he does but the kind of man he is.\n\"At a time when the cheery economic indicators don't tell the whole story about the struggles of everyday people, when the world lurches from emergency to emergency without America's influence or leadership, when Republican leadership wants to take health care away, abandon public education, and ignore a climate crisis, and when our current president seeks to create chaos and division instead of order and unity, Joe knows that the times and challenges before us demand new ideas and bold actions. But he also knows that change that lasts will require us to turn to each other rather than on each other, and that we will have to model a politics that says we don't have to agree on everything before we work together on anything. Joe is that leader and with his leadership we can win the White House, as well as majorities in the House and the Senate, and get going on with the work of making America prosperous and just for all Americans everywhere.\"\nPatrick, a former Democratic presidential candidate, joins the more than 100 Bay State leaders who have previously announced their endorsement for Joe Biden for President, including former Secretary of State John Kerry, Congressman Seth Moulton, Congressman Stephen Lynch, State Sen. Marc Pacheco, Vicky Kennedy, and an array of state legislators, mayors, city councilors, and more.\nNationally, Biden for President has previously announced more than 1,500 endorsements from national, state, and local leaders, including current and former U.S. senators and representatives, governors, state elected officials, community leaders, and national security professionals.\n",
